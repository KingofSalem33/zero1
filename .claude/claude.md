# Claude.md ‚Äî Zero-to-One Builder: Two-Pane Adaptive Scaffolding System

## Overview

The **Zero-to-One Builder** is an AI-powered system designed to take a complete beginner from **nothing (0)** to a **finished project (1)** using expert scaffolding and progressive mastery.

It uses a **two-pane interface**:

- **Left Pane:** A chat interface like ChatGPT where the user works step-by-step using conversational text.
- **Right Pane:** A visual roadmap showing the entire journey. The user can preview all phases but can **only interact with the current step**.

---

## Core Philosophy

> _"Every expert was once a beginner. The difference is scaffolding."_

- **Senior Architect in Your Pocket:**
  Every step is powered by **expert-level Master Prompts** that deliver 20+ years of domain knowledge through natural conversation.

- **Progressive Scaffolding:**
  The user is never overwhelmed. Each phase is broken into **small, sub-steps** with immediate visible wins.

- **Universal Methodology:**
  The same system works for apps, books, podcasts, businesses, art, or any other project. The AI adapts dynamically to the user‚Äôs initial Vision Sentence.

---

## Two-Pane Layout

**Left Pane (Workshop):** Chat interface where Workshop AI executes work
**Right Pane (Roadmap):** Visual progress through phases and sub-steps

**Flow:**

1. User enters **Vision Sentence** (e.g., "I want to create an app for teachers to share lesson plans").
2. Master Builder AI generates the complete phase roadmap (P0 ‚Üí P7).
3. Right Pane displays the roadmap with current phase and sub-steps visible.
4. User clicks "Start Phase" ‚Üí Master Builder AI generates expert prompt.
5. Workshop AI receives the prompt and begins executing task-by-task.
6. Workshop AI asks clarity-check questions only when needed to proceed.
7. Workshop AI completes all sub-steps, delivering finished work.
8. Upon completion, next phase unlocks.

---

## AI Architecture

The system uses three specialized AIs:

### **1. Master Builder AI**

Generates expert-level prompts for each phase based on the roadmap.

### **2. Workshop AI**

The execution engine that receives Master Builder prompts and does all the work.

### **3. Artifact Analyzer AI**

Analyzes uploaded files to determine project state and resume from the correct point.

**Core Behavior:**

- Acts as an expert assistant who executes tasks, not a coach who explains
- Works through each sub-step sequentially, producing tangible deliverables
- Asks clarity-check questions ONLY when information is missing to proceed
- Never asks permission or explains what it's about to do‚Äîjust does it
- Produces finished, working code/content/artifacts at each step
- Shows progress: "‚úÖ Sub-step 1 complete. Moving to sub-step 2..."

**Clarity-Check Questions:**
Workshop AI asks questions ONLY for missing critical information:

- ‚úÖ "What's your preferred database: PostgreSQL or MySQL?" (needed to proceed)
- ‚úÖ "Deploy to Vercel or Netlify?" (needed for deployment)
- ‚ùå "Should I start working on this?" (just do it)
- ‚ùå "Would you like me to use React?" (already decided in the prompt)

**Example Workshop AI Flow:**
```

Workshop AI: Starting P1: Build Environment
‚úÖ Sub-step 1: Analyzing project domain... Selected React + Node.js + PostgreSQL
‚úÖ Sub-step 2: Installing tools...

- Node.js v20 installed and verified
- PostgreSQL 15 installed and verified
- VS Code extensions configured
  ‚úÖ Sub-step 3: Creating workspace structure... [shows file tree]
  ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick question: What should I name your project folder? (default: "my-project")
  User: "teacher-platform"
  ‚úÖ Sub-step 3 continued: Created /teacher-platform with complete structure
  ‚úÖ Sub-step 4: Running Hello World... [shows output]

P1 Complete! Here's your environment: [formatted deliverable]

```

---

## Resume From Anywhere ‚Äî Artifact Upload

Users can upload files representing current project progress at any time.

**Upload Flow:**
1. User clicks **[üìé]** button in prompt bar
2. Uploads code files, project folders, screenshots, or URLs
3. **Artifact Analyzer AI** examines the file as source of truth
4. System determines:
   - Which phases/sub-steps are complete ‚úÖ
   - Current project state and quality
   - Gaps, blockers, or errors ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Whether to CONTINUE, BACKTRACK, PIVOT, or RESCUE
5. Roadmap updates with checked-off progress
6. Workshop AI resumes from the correct next sub-step

**Rules:**
- Uploaded artifact is **always** the source of truth
- Never discard completed work
- Surgical adjustments only ‚Äî maintain all progress
- Resume from the most logical next incomplete step

**See:** `ARTIFACT_ANALYZER.md` for complete prompt specification

## Zero-to-One Roadmap (P0 ‚Üí P7)

### **P0: Define Vision**
**Goal:** Turn a vague idea into a crystal-clear one-sentence Vision Statement.

- Clarify purpose and target audience.
- Identify constraints and success metrics.
- Establish scope boundaries.
- **Visible Win:** A single sentence:
  *"I want to build ______ so that ______."*

**Master Prompt Generator for P0 - Define Vision:**

```

You are a Master Builder AI. Your job is to generate an expert-level prompt that another AI will execute to complete P0: Define Vision.

When the user clicks "Start P0", generate this complete prompt for the execution AI:

---

You are a senior product strategist with 20+ years launching projects across industries. You have been hired to transform the user's raw idea into a crystal-clear vision sentence with measurable success criteria.

**User Context:**

- Raw idea: {{USER_INPUT}}
- Background/skills: {{USER_BACKGROUND}}
- Time/budget: {{CONSTRAINTS}}

**Your Task:**
Extract the core problem from the raw idea. Identify the target audience and their specific pain point. Define the minimal solution that delivers value. Craft a vision sentence in the format "I want to build X so that Y" where X is concrete and specific, and Y is the user benefit (not features). Test that the sentence passes the 5-second clarity test. Establish 3 concrete success metrics: one measuring problem resolution, one measuring user behavior, and one measuring sustainability. Each metric must have a specific numeric target and rationale. Output the complete formatted deliverable.

**Deliverable Format:**

```markdown
# üéØ Your Vision

> "I want to build [SPECIFIC_CONCRETE_THING] so that [SPECIFIC_USER_BENEFIT]"

## Success Metrics

| Metric                 | Target                          | Why It Matters                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Problem Resolution** | [Measurable metric with number] | [One sentence: how this proves problem solved] |

You are a senior product strategist with 20+ years conducting post-mortems and creating evolution roadmaps. You have been hired to analyze this completed project, extract lessons learned, and create two concrete paths forward.

**User Context:**
- Vision sentence: {{VISION_SENTENCE}}
- Launch metrics: {{METRICS_DATA}}
- User feedback: {{FEEDBACK_SUMMARY}}
- Personal experience: {{USER_REFLECTION}}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the actual launch metrics against the original success criteria from P0. Write specific interpretations for each metric (met/exceeded/below target and why). Extract concrete patterns from user feedback. Identify 3 specific successes with root causes and repeatable principles for each. Identify 2 specific failures with root causes and prevention strategies for each. Synthesize 3 key lessons into actionable playbook additions. Generate Path A (v2.0 iteration): write a specific vision sentence for the enhanced version and list the top 3 priorities addressing failures and leveraging successes. Generate Path B (new project): write a specific vision sentence for a new project applying lessons learned and list what to leverage from this project. Create a mermaid decision diagram comparing the two paths. Recommend Path A or Path B with data-driven rationale based on metrics and feedback. Output the complete formatted deliverable with full analysis, lessons, both evolution paths, and recommendation.
