Zero-to-One Builder — Two-Pane Adaptive Scaffolding (Condensed)
What it is

An AI system that takes a beginner from 0 → 1 using a two-pane UI and phase-based scaffolding:

Left (Workshop): conversational execution—AI does the work step-by-step.

Right (Roadmap): full journey P0→P7 visible; only current step is interactive.

Core philosophy

Senior Architect in your pocket: expert prompts encode 20+ years of craft.

Progressive scaffolding: tiny sub-steps with visible wins; no overwhelm.

Universal method: adapts to any domain from a one-sentence Vision.

AI architecture (3 agents)

Master Builder AI — generates expert prompts per phase.

Workshop AI — executes deliverables sequentially; shows progress.

Artifact Analyzer AI — reads uploaded files to detect state and resume.

Workshop AI operating rules

Executes; doesn’t ask permission or narrate intent.

Clarity-checks only when blocking: e.g., “PostgreSQL or MySQL?”

Produces tangible artifacts; reports: “✅ Sub-step N complete…”

Resume from artifacts

Users upload code/folders/URLs/screens.

Uploaded artifact = source of truth.

System marks done/remaining, then CONTINUE / BACKTRACK / PIVOT / RESCUE and resumes at the next logical sub-step.

Roadmap P0 → P7 (essentials)

Each phase has 2–5 sub-steps and a visible win. Master Builder supplies a ready-to-run prompt for Workshop AI.

P0: Define Vision — craft “I want to build X so that Y” + 3 numeric success metrics.
Sub-steps: extract problem/audience → write vision → set metrics.

P1: Build Environment — select stack/tools; install & verify; scaffold workspace; run Hello World.

P2: Core Loop — build the smallest Input → Process → Output that proves value; real test with concrete input/output.

P3: Layered Expansion — add one high-value feature; integrate; test core + feature + end-to-end; recommend next layer.

P4: Reality Test — 2–3 min demo, test script, observation checklist, success metrics; decision matrix: PROCEED / PIVOT / KILL.

P5: Polish & Freeze — fix critical & important only; declare v1.0 scope freeze; verify launch checklist.

P6: Launch — deploy to public URL; headline + CTA + 10-word value prop; push across 3 channels; track 3 live metrics; 48-hour watch.

P7: Reflect & Evolve — compare metrics vs P0 targets; extract wins/failures; add to playbook; propose Path A (v2.0) and Path B (new); recommend one.

Why it works

Plan vs Do separation: roadmap clarity + execution focus.

Visible wins maintain momentum.

Expert prompts compress experience; artifact-driven continuity.

Minimal technical requirements

State tracking: vision, current phase, sub-step progress.

Prompt injection: right-pane phase → generates Master prompt for left pane.

Preview mode: whole roadmap visible; interactions locked to current step.

Endgame

After P7 the user has a live, launch-ready project, documented lessons, and a data-backed next path (v2.0 or new project)—moving from one shipped thing → many.
