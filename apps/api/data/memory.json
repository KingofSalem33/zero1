        "content": "This passage is the Bible’s own introduction to Samson: his parents’ encounter with the “angel of the LORD,” the promise of his birth, his early blessing, and the first glimpse of his adult life.\n\n## 1. Manoah and his wife see the “angel of the LORD” (Judges 13:21–22)\n\n“*But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.*” (Judges 13:21–22)\n\nTwo key truths appear here:\n\n1. **Recognition of the angel of the LORD**  \n   At first, Manoah did not fully understand who this visitor was, but when the “angel of the LORD did no more appear,” *then* he knew what had happened:  \n   “Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD” (13:21).\n\n2. **The angel of the LORD is identified with God**  \n   Manoah’s reaction shows how he understood this experience:  \n   “We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (13:22)\n\n   From the text itself:\n   - The one they saw is called “the angel of the LORD” (13:21).\n   - Manoah equates seeing this angel with having “seen God” (13:22).\n   \n   So, in this passage, the “angel of the LORD” is not treated as a mere created messenger; Manoah understands that in seeing this angel, they have in some sense seen God Himself. His fear—“We shall surely die”—comes from the sense of God’s overwhelming holiness and greatness.\n\n## 2. Manoah’s wife reasons from God’s actions and words (Judges 13:23)\n\n“*But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.*” (Judges 13:23)\n\nManoah’s wife answers his fear with calm, Spirit-taught reasoning based entirely on what the LORD has *already done* for them:\n\n1. **God accepted their offerings**  \n   “He would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands.”  \n   If God meant only to destroy them, He would not have accepted their worship.\n\n2. **God had revealed great things to them**  \n   “Neither would he have shewed us all these things.”  \n   He had shown them things—promises and signs—connected with His purpose.\n\n3. **God had spoken promises to them**  \n   “Nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.”  \n   He had told them specific things about what He would do (including the child to be born).\n\nHer conclusion is simple and powerful:  \n- Since the LORD **received** their offerings,  \n- and **revealed** His works,  \n- and **spoke** gracious promises to them,  \n\nHe is not planning to kill them. She trusts the character of God as it is revealed in His acceptance, His revelation, and His promises.\n\nThus, within these verses, faith is shown not as a vague feeling, but as a clear, reasonable trust grounded in what God has actually said and done.\n\n## 3. Samson’s birth and early blessing (Judges 13:24)\n\n“*And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.*” (Judges 13:24)\n\nHere the promise is fulfilled:\n\n- “The woman bare a son” – God did exactly what He had said He would do.\n- “Called his name Samson” – the child is specifically marked out.\n- “The child grew, and the LORD blessed him” – God’s favor rested on him from childhood.\n\nThis verse shows:\n- **God’s faithfulness** – what God had promised through the angel of the LORD is now visibly accomplished.\n- **God’s initiative** – before Samson does anything, we are told the LORD is already blessing him.\n\nSamson is thus introduced as a child of divine promise, raised under the special blessing of the LORD.\n\n## 4. The Spirit of the LORD begins to move Samson (Judges 13:25)\n\n“*And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.*” (Judges 13:25)\n\nBefore any of Samson’s famous deeds are mentioned, we are told:\n\n- It is **“the Spirit of the LORD”** who is at work.\n- He “began to move him at times” – not constantly recorded, but at intervals, in particular seasons.\n- This happens “in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol” – a specific region among Samson’s own people.\n\nFrom this, the text shows:\n\n1. **Samson’s strength and calling have a spiritual source**  \n   Whatever will follow in Samson’s life, the source is not merely natural ability; it begins with the Spirit of the LORD.\n\n2. **God prepares His servant before the public stories begin**  \n   Long before we read about Samson’s public acts, the Spirit is already stirring him “at times.” The LORD is quietly shaping and moving him.\n\nSo we now see a line:\n- The LORD **promised** Samson (through the angel).\n- The LORD **blessed** Samson as he grew.\n- The **Spirit of the LORD** begins to move him.\n\nSamson’s life is clearly begun and driven by God’s own work.\n\n## 5. Samson’s first recorded adult choice (Judges 14:1–2)\n\n“*And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.*” (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nHaving seen the divine background to Samson’s life, the text now shows us his first recorded action as a grown man:\n\n1. **Samson moves from his own people’s area toward Philistine territory**  \n   “Samson went down to Timnath” – a Philistine-associated place.  \n   The direction “went down” underscores a movement from his own home region to another people.\n\n2. **Samson is drawn to a Philistine woman**  \n   He “saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines” (14:1).  \n   His focus here is not on battle or deliverance, but on a woman he desires as a wife.\n\n3. **Samson speaks commandingly to his parents**  \n   He tells them: “Now therefore get her for me to wife.” (14:2)  \n   This shows:\n   - He involves his parents in arranging the marriage.\n   - He speaks with strong insistence.\n\nThe text does not, in these verses alone, directly pass moral judgment on this choice. But it places this event **immediately after** telling us that:\n\n- “The LORD blessed him” (13:24).\n- “The Spirit of the LORD began to move him” (13:25).\n\nSo the reader is meant to notice a tension:\n- On one side: a man especially blessed and moved by the Spirit of the LORD.\n- On the other: his first recorded concern is to take a wife “of the daughters of the Philistines.”\n\nWithin just these verses, we can say:\n- Samson is truly God’s chosen instrument (promised child, blessed, Spirit-moved).\n- Yet he is also a man making strong, personal decisions that will shape his life.\n\n## 6. Putting it together: Who is Samson in this passage?\n\nFrom Judges 13:21–14:2, Samson appears as:\n\n1. **A child of divine promise and revelation**  \n   His parents received a visit from “the angel of the LORD,” whom Manoah identifies with God Himself (13:21–22). His birth comes after supernatural revelation and offerings accepted by the LORD.\n\n2. **A testimony to God’s faithfulness**  \n   Manoah’s wife reasons, “If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering… nor would… have told us such things as these” (13:23).  \n   Samson’s birth in verse 24 proves that the LORD indeed meant to bless, not destroy.\n\n3. **A man under the LORD’s blessing and the Spirit’s moving**  \n   “The LORD blessed him” (13:24).  \n   “The Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times” (13:25).  \n   His strength and role do not begin with himself; they begin with God.\n\n4. **A man whose choices will unfold within that divine calling**  \n   As soon as his adulthood enters the story, he “went down to Timnath” and desired a Philistine woman for his wife (14:1–2). The rest of Samson’s life (beyond this provided passage) will develop from this tension between God’s calling and Samson’s personal desires.\n\nIn summary, on the basis of this passage alone, Samson is introduced as a divinely promised and blessed deliverer, marked by God’s own presence and Spirit from the beginning, yet still very much a man whose decisions—and particularly his dealings with the Philistines—will become central to how God’s purpose works out through him."

        "content": "Samson is first introduced in this passage as a child of promise, given by God, blessed by God, and moved by the Spirit of the LORD—yet immediately placed in a story that will involve the Philistines.\n\n## 1. The setting: Manoah, his wife, and the angel of the LORD (Judges 13:21–23)\n\nAfter the angel of the LORD finishes speaking with Manoah and his wife, we read:\n\n> “But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. **Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.**  \n> And Manoah said unto his wife, **We shall surely die, because we have seen God.**” (Judges 13:21–22)\n\nTwo things stand out:\n\n1. Manoah now understands that this visitor truly was “an angel of the LORD.”  \n2. Yet he says, “we have seen God,” and fears death.\n\nSo, in Manoah’s understanding, seeing this “angel of the LORD” is equivalent to having “seen God.” That shows the weight and holiness of this appearance. He expects judgment: “We shall surely die.”\n\nBut his wife answers with sober, faith-filled reasoning:\n\n> “But his wife said unto him, **If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands**, neither would he have shewed us all these things, **nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.**” (Judges 13:23)\n\nHer argument rests on three things God has just done:\n\n1. He **received their offerings** (“burnt offering and a meat offering”).  \n2. He **showed them “all these things”** – that is, He revealed His purpose.  \n3. He **told them** specific promises “at this time.”\n\nHer conclusion: if God meant only to kill them in judgment, He would not have accepted their sacrifice, revealed such things, and spoken such promises. This is how faith reasons from God’s actions and words: acceptance of the offering and gracious revelation are signs of favour, not wrath.\n\nSo even before Samson is born, his story is rooted in:\n\n- A fearful sense of God’s holiness (“we have seen God”), and  \n- A confident trust in God’s mercy shown through accepted offering and promise.\n\n## 2. Samson’s birth, blessing, and the moving of the Spirit (Judges 13:24–25)\n\nThe promise is then fulfilled:\n\n> “And the woman bare a son, and called his name **Samson**: **and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.**” (Judges 13:24)\n\nSamson’s very existence is the result of God’s direct intervention and promise. The verse is simple but weighty:\n\n- He is **named** (“called his name Samson”) – this child is marked out.  \n- He **grew** – God’s promise was not empty; the child lived and developed.  \n- “**The LORD blessed him**” – God’s favour rested on him from childhood.\n\nThen we are told how God began to work in him:\n\n> “And **the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times** in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.” (Judges 13:25)\n\nKey points:\n\n- It is **the Spirit of the LORD** who stirs Samson. His coming role as a deliverer does not arise from his own strength alone but from God’s Spirit.  \n- The Spirit “**began to move him at times**” – not continuously, but in particular seasons and moments. This suggests a gradual beginning of his God-given work.  \n- This happens “**in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol**” – among his own people and territory. Before he ever confronts the Philistines, the Spirit is already at work stirring him where he belongs.\n\nThus, Samson is shown as:\n\n- A **promised child**,  \n- **Blessed by the LORD**,  \n- **Moved by the Spirit of the LORD**.\n\nHis calling and strength, as introduced here, are clearly from God, not from himself.\n\n## 3. Samson’s first recorded desire: a Philistine woman (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nThe next thing we read jumps to Samson as a young man:\n\n> “And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.  \n> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, **I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.**” (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nSeveral details are emphasized:\n\n- He **“went down” to Timnath** – he leaves the territory described as “the camp of Dan” (13:25) and goes into a place associated here with **the Philistines**.  \n- Twice it is said that the woman is “**of the daughters of the Philistines**” (14:1–2). The text stresses her Philistine identity.  \n- Samson’s words: “**I have seen a woman … now therefore get her for me to wife.**” What he has **seen** governs what he **wants**. His first recorded act is to seek a wife from among the Philistines and to press his parents to arrange it.\n\nSo, immediately after we hear that “the Spirit of the LORD began to move him” (13:25), we see Samson moving toward a connection with the Philistines (14:1–2). The text does not yet explain the purpose; it simply sets the stage: the God-blessed, Spirit-moved man is now directly involved with “the daughters of the Philistines.”\n\n## 4. Pulling it together: What do these verses teach us about Samson?\n\nFrom this anchor passage, without any additional cross-references, we learn these core truths about Samson:\n\n1. **His life begins in the context of a divine encounter.**  \n   His parents see “the angel of the LORD” (13:21), and Manoah says, “we have seen God” (13:22). Samson’s birth is tied directly to God’s self-revelation.\n\n2. **His coming is bound up with sacrifice and accepted worship.**  \n   Manoah’s wife reasons that because the LORD **received their burnt and meat offerings** and gave them promises, He does not intend to kill them (13:23). Samson’s arrival is a sign of God’s mercy, not judgment.\n\n3. **He is a child of promise, blessed from his youth.**  \n   “The woman bare a son… and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him” (13:24). Before Samson does anything, Scripture first marks him as one blessed by God.\n\n4. **His strength and calling are from the Spirit of the LORD.**  \n   “The Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times” (13:25). Whatever Samson will become in Israel’s history, this passage makes clear that it is **the LORD’s Spirit** who initiates his work.\n\n5. **His story is immediately intertwined with the Philistines.**  \n   The very next scene is Samson “went down to Timnath” and fixing his desire on “a woman… of the daughters of the Philistines” (14:1–2). The first recorded desire of this Spirit-moved man involves the Philistines, hinting that his life and theirs will be closely connected.\n\nThere are no additional rings (no cross-references supplied) to expand this picture here, so the focus remains on this foundation: Samson is a God-given, Spirit-stirred man, whose life begins in the light of God’s accepted sacrifice and promises, and whose path quickly leads into dealings with the Philistines.\n\nIf you’d like, we can next trace the rest of Samson’s story in Judges and see how this beginning shapes everything that follows."

        "content": "Samson, in the passage given, is introduced as a **child of promise**, a **sign of God’s mercy**, and a man **moved by the Spirit of the LORD**, whose life quickly shows tension between divine calling and personal desire.\n\n## 1. The context: seeing “the angel of the LORD” and fearing death (Judges 13:21–23)\n\nFirst, the focus is on Samson’s parents, Manoah and his wife:\n\n> “But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.  \n> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (Judges 13:21–22)\n\nManoah realizes that the one who had spoken with them was not a mere man but “an angel of the LORD.” His response is fear:  \n“We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (13:22)\n\nFrom these words, the passage itself shows:\n- Manoah connects “the angel of the LORD” with “seeing God.”\n- He believes that to see God means certain death.\n\nBut his wife reasons differently:\n\n> “But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.” (Judges 13:23)\n\nShe draws three clear conclusions from what the LORD has just done for them:\n1. **He received their offerings**:  \n   “he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands,”  \n   – Acceptance of their sacrifice is a sign of favor, not intent to destroy.\n2. **He showed them “all these things”**:  \n   – The visions and signs they saw were gracious revelations, not preparations for judgment.\n3. **He spoke promises to them**:  \n   – “nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.”  \n   – God’s promises about what is to come (which include the birth of Samson) prove He intends life, not death.\n\nSo before Samson is even born, the text ties his coming to:\n- God’s **mercy** instead of destruction,\n- God’s **acceptance** of sacrifice,\n- God’s **spoken promise** that must now be fulfilled.\n\n## 2. Samson’s birth and blessing (Judges 13:24)\n\nThen the promise turns to reality:\n\n> “And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.” (Judges 13:24)\n\nSeveral simple but weighty truths are given:\n\n- “The woman bare a son” – God’s word to them has come to pass.\n- “called his name Samson” – his very name is linked to this miraculous, God-announced birth.\n- “the child grew, and **the LORD blessed him**” – from his early days, his life is marked by divine favor. The text does not yet tell us what this blessing looks like, but clearly his growth is under the LORD’s hand.\n\nThus, Samson is not a random figure; he is:\n- The **evidence** that God did not intend to kill Manoah and his wife.\n- The **fulfillment** of the words God had spoken.\n- A **blessed** child, set apart by God’s own action and favor.\n\n## 3. The Spirit of the LORD moves Samson (Judges 13:25)\n\nThe passage then shifts from general blessing to spiritual stirring:\n\n> “And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.” (Judges 13:25)\n\nThis adds a deeper layer:\n\n- “The Spirit of the LORD” – God’s own Spirit is at work in Samson.\n- “began to move him at times” – this is not a constant possession described here, but specific movements or stirrings. His actions at certain moments are prompted or empowered by God’s Spirit.\n- “in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol” – his activity is first noted among his own people (Dan), in a known region.\n\nFrom this, the passage reveals:\n- Samson is not just blessed generally; he is **specially stirred** and **moved** by the Spirit of the LORD.\n- His role is not merely personal; his movements have to do with the people among whom he dwells (“the camp of Dan”).\n\nSo within this anchor passage, Samson is clearly:\n- A man uniquely **touched and driven by the Spirit of God** at certain times.\n- A figure whose life is part of God’s dealings with His people (located among the tribe of Dan).\n\n## 4. Samson’s desire and the Philistine woman (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nThe narrative then takes a turn into Samson’s early adult choices:\n\n> “And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.  \n> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.” (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nHere we see:\n\n- Samson travels: “went down to Timnath.”\n- He is attracted to “a woman…of the daughters of the Philistines.”\n- He returns to his parents and speaks with authority and insistence:  \n  “I have seen a woman…of the daughters of the Philistines: **now therefore get her for me to wife.**”\n\nThis shows another side:\n\n1. Samson is **active, decisive, and strong-willed.**\n2. His desire is set on a woman who is explicitly identified as **Philistine**, not one of his own people.\n3. He expects his parents to arrange the marriage in accordance with his desire.\n\nPlaced immediately after “the Spirit of the LORD began to move him” (13:25), this creates a tension in the passage:\n- On one side: **the LORD blessed him** and **the Spirit of the LORD** moves him.\n- On the other: Samson’s own **strong personal desires**, focused on a woman outside Israel.\n\nThe text here does not yet explain God’s purpose in this choice; it simply records it. But even from these few verses, Samson stands as:\n- A **God-blessed, Spirit-moved man**,  \n- Yet also a man whose **will and desires** are very strong and begin to shape his story.\n\n## 5. Pulling it together from the Anchor Passage\n\nUsing only the verses provided (Judges 13:21–14:2), we can say:\n\n- Samson’s very existence is tied to a **direct encounter with “the angel of the LORD”**, understood by Manoah as “seeing God” (13:21–22).\n- The fear of death from seeing God is answered by the clear signs of God’s **favor**:\n  - acceptance of offerings,  \n  - the revelation of “all these things,”  \n  - and His gracious promises (13:23).\n- Samson’s birth is the **fulfillment** of that promise, and his growth is under **the LORD’s blessing** (13:24).\n- As he matures, **the Spirit of the LORD** begins to **move him at times**, marking him as a man God is stirring for His own purposes (13:25).\n- Yet, when his adult choices begin to appear, he is shown as **assertive and driven by his own eyes and desires**, particularly in choosing a wife from among the Philistines (14:1–2).\n\nThus, from this passage alone, Samson is introduced as:\n- **A child of divine promise**,  \n- **A sign of God’s mercy rather than judgment**,  \n- **A man blessed by the LORD and moved by His Spirit**,  \n- And **a strong-willed individual whose personal desires quickly come to the forefront**.\n\nEverything that follows in his life (beyond these verses) will unfold from this tension between divine calling and human will already visible here."

        "content": "This passage introduces Samson at the very beginning of his life and shows how God marked him out before he ever acted as a man.\n\n## 1. Manoah and his wife see the angel of the LORD (Judges 13:21–23)\n\nThe scene begins not with Samson himself, but with his parents and a visitation from heaven:\n\n> “But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.” (Judges 13:21)\n\nEarlier in the chapter (just before the portion we are given), the “angel of the LORD” has appeared to Manoah and his wife and spoken to them. Now, when the angel departs in a miraculous way, Manoah finally understands who this visitor really was – “an angel of the LORD.”\n\nManoah’s reaction shows the fear and reverence he has for God’s presence:\n\n> “And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (Judges 13:22)\n\nNotice the connection in the text:\n\n- The being is called “the angel of the LORD” (v. 21).\n- Yet Manoah says, “we have seen God” (v. 22).\n\nThe Scripture does not pause to explain this mystery, but it clearly shows that Manoah understood this encounter as a direct, terrifying nearness to God Himself. He believes that to see God is to be in danger of death.\n\nHis wife, however, answers with faith and sound reasoning based on what God has just done:\n\n> “But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.” (Judges 13:23)\n\nShe reasons in three ways:\n\n1. **God received their offerings** – “he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands.” Acceptance of sacrifice in this passage is a sign of God’s favour, not His intention to destroy them.\n\n2. **God has shown them “all these things”** – the visions, the appearance of the angel, the miracles. Such revelation points to a purpose of blessing, not judgment.\n\n3. **God has spoken promises to them** – “nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.” He has given them a word about the future (the birth of a child). If His plan were to kill them, such words of future blessing would make no sense.\n\nFrom this, we see a principle drawn directly from the verses: when God accepts an offering, grants revelation, and speaks of future blessing, it is evidence that His purpose toward that person is life and mercy, not immediate destruction.\n\nSo even before Samson is born, the passage emphasizes God’s mercy, His presence, and the assurance that flows from His accepted sacrifice and spoken promise.\n\n## 2. Samson’s birth and early blessing (Judges 13:24–25)\n\nNow the child himself appears:\n\n> “And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.” (Judges 13:24)\n\nSeveral things are clear and simple:\n\n- Samson is the direct result of the LORD’s promise. His birth comes after a divine announcement and a heavenly visitation.\n- His parents name him “Samson.”\n- As he grows up, “the LORD blessed him.” Whatever else we will read of Samson later, his early life carries a clear mark of God’s favour and purpose.\n\nThen we are told something further about his spiritual experience:\n\n> “And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.” (Judges 13:25)\n\nKey points from this verse:\n\n- **“The Spirit of the LORD”** is the source of Samson’s stirrings. His strength and actions, as they will later appear, are not mere natural ability; they are connected to the Spirit’s moving.\n- **“Began to move him at times”** – this suggests that, while Samson is still young, there are particular moments when God’s Spirit stirs him. These are special seasons or occasions, not a constant description of his every moment.\n- **“In the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol”** – Samson’s early stirrings by the Spirit are rooted among his own people, in a specific place within Israel.\n\nTaken together, verses 24–25 show that Samson is:\n\n- A child given in fulfilment of God’s word.\n- Blessed by the LORD as he grows.\n- Moved by the Spirit of the LORD even before his public acts are recorded.\n\nSamson, then, is not an accidental figure—he is a man raised up by God, blessed by God, and stirred by God’s Spirit.\n\n## 3. Samson’s first recorded desire as a man (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nThe next scene moves quickly from his youth to his adult choices:\n\n> “And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.” (Judges 14:1)\n\nHere we learn:\n\n- Samson leaves his own area (“went down to Timnath”).\n- He “saw a woman… of the daughters of the Philistines.”\n\nThe Philistines are a distinct people; this is not an Israelite woman. The text does not yet comment here on whether this is good or evil, but it clearly notes the difference: she is “of the daughters of the Philistines.”\n\nSamson’s response is strong and direct:\n\n> “And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.” (Judges 14:2)\n\nA few things stand out, simply from the wording:\n\n- He repeats her identity: she is “of the daughters of the Philistines.” This is not hidden from his parents.\n- He speaks commandingly: “now therefore get her for me to wife.” We see something of Samson’s determined will.\n\nWhen we set this beside the previous verses, a contrast appears in the flow of the passage:\n\n- Manoah and his wife, in chapter 13, tremble before God’s presence, offer sacrifices, and reason in terms of God’s acceptance and promises.\n- Their son, Samson, introduced as blessed and moved by the Spirit of the LORD, is next shown choosing a wife from among the Philistines and pressing his parents to secure her for him.\n\nThe text at this point does not explain God’s purpose in this choice or whether God will overrule it; it simply states the fact and lets the story unfold from there in the following verses (beyond what we are given here).\n\n## 4. What this passage teaches us about Samson\n\nStaying strictly within these verses, we can summarize Samson as follows:\n\n1. **A man whose life begins with a direct act of God’s grace.**  \n   His parents have seen the angel of the LORD, feared death for having “seen God,” yet are assured by the signs of accepted sacrifice and spoken promise. Out of this encounter, Samson is born (Judges 13:21–24).\n\n2. **A man specially blessed by the LORD.**  \n   “The child grew, and the LORD blessed him” (Judges 13:24). His early life is under God’s favour.\n\n3. **A man stirred by the Spirit of the LORD.**  \n   “The Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times” (Judges 13:25). Whatever Samson does later, his strength and role are rooted in these divine movings.\n\n4. **A man of strong and definite desires.**  \n   The first recorded adult action we see is his insistence on taking a Philistine woman to wife: “now therefore get her for me to wife” (Judges 14:2). This shows his forceful will and introduces tension between his divine calling and his personal choices.\n\nIn this way, the passage presents Samson as a man chosen and empowered by God from birth, yet also a man whose desires and decisions will play a major role in how that calling is worked out. The verses given emphasize God’s presence, God’s promise, God’s blessing, and God’s Spirit at the foundation of his life, and then immediately show us the kind of man Samson is as he begins to act on his own."

        "content": "Samson, in this passage, is introduced to us as a man whose life begins with a direct intervention from God and is marked by the working of “the Spirit of the LORD,” yet also as a man quickly shown to act according to what he sees and desires.\n\n## 1. The divine visitation and the fear of Manoah (Judges 13:21–22)\n\nFirst, the focus is on Samson’s parents, Manoah and his wife, and their encounter with “the angel of the LORD”:\n\n> “But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.  \n> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (Judges 13:21–22)\n\nThe text calls this figure “the angel of the LORD,” yet Manoah says, “we have seen God” and expects death. This shows:\n\n- Manoah understands this appearance to be no mere created messenger but a manifestation of God Himself.\n- His reaction reflects the seriousness of God’s holiness as he believes that seeing God means certain death.\n\nSo before Samson is even born, his story is rooted in a direct and fearful manifestation of God to his parents.\n\n## 2. The faith and reasoning of Manoah’s wife (Judges 13:23)\n\nManoah’s wife responds with calm spiritual reasoning:\n\n> “But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.” (Judges 13:23)\n\nShe reasons from what God has just done:\n\n- God **received** their “burnt offering and a meat offering.”\n- He **shewed** them “all these things.”\n- He **told** them “such things as these” – that is, He gave them revelation and promise.\n\nHer conclusion: these are signs of God’s favor, not His intention to destroy them. If the LORD meant to kill them, He would not have accepted their offerings nor spoken graciously to them.\n\nThus, the foundation of Samson’s life is laid in:\n\n- A revelation from God.\n- Acceptance of sacrifice.\n- A word of promise that implies future blessing, not immediate judgment.\n\n## 3. Samson’s birth and early blessing (Judges 13:24)\n\nThen the promised child is born:\n\n> “And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.” (Judges 13:24)\n\nHere we learn several key things about Samson:\n\n- His birth directly follows the divine visitation and promise.\n- His parents name him “Samson.”\n- As he grows, “the LORD blessed him.”\n\nSo Samson is not just another child in Israel. His coming is tied to a supernatural revelation, and from his youth he is under the evident blessing of the LORD.\n\n## 4. The Spirit of the LORD moving Samson (Judges 13:25)\n\nNext we are told about the beginning of his calling:\n\n> “And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.” (Judges 13:25)\n\nImportant details:\n\n- It is **“the Spirit of the LORD”** who acts.\n- The Spirit “began to move him at times” – not continuously, but in particular seasons.\n- This happens “in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol,” locating Samson among his own people.\n\nWhatever Samson will become as a judge and deliverer, this passage makes clear:\n\n- His power and impulses toward his calling come from **the Spirit of the LORD**, not from himself.\n- God is the One initiating his movements “at times.”\n\nThus, the text presents Samson as a man specially stirred and empowered by God’s Spirit.\n\n## 5. Samson’s first recorded choice: led by what he sees (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nImmediately after we read of the Spirit moving him, the narrative shows us his first specific action:\n\n> “And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.  \n> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.” (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nSeveral things stand out, especially in contrast with what came before:\n\n1. The emphasis on **sight**:  \n   - “Samson … saw a woman in Timnath…”  \n   - He tells his parents, “I have seen a woman…”\n\n   His desire is driven by what he sees.\n\n2. The woman is “of the daughters of the Philistines.”  \n   The text marks her as a Philistine woman, not one of Israel. Whatever else the larger book will say about Philistines, this passage is clearly highlighting that Samson directs his affection outside his own people.\n\n3. Samson’s strong demand:  \n   - “Now therefore get her for me to wife.”\n\n   Earlier, Manoah’s wife reasoned carefully from God’s word and works (13:23). Now their son, already blessed by the LORD and moved by the Spirit, speaks to them in a forceful, self-directed way based on what he has seen.\n\nSo, in just these verses, a tension begins to appear:\n\n- On the one hand: Samson is blessed by the LORD and moved by the Spirit of the LORD (13:24–25).\n- On the other: his first recorded pursuit is a woman he has merely “seen,” a Philistine, and he insists his parents secure her for his wife (14:1–2).\n\nThe passage does not yet pronounce judgment or approval on this choice; it simply shows it, immediately after emphasizing the Spirit’s movement in his life.\n\n## 6. Drawing the picture together\n\nFrom just this anchor passage (Judges 13:21–14:2), Samson appears as:\n\n- A child whose coming is marked by a fearful yet gracious manifestation of God:  \n  Manoah says, “we have seen God” and fears death (13:22), but his wife understands that God’s acceptance of their offerings and His promises mean He intends life and blessing (13:23).\n\n- A son born under divine promise and favor:  \n  “The LORD blessed him” as he grew (13:24).\n\n- A man stirred by the Spirit of the LORD:  \n  “The Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times” (13:25). His calling and strength have their source in God’s Spirit.\n\n- Yet also a man quickly shown as driven by what he sees and desires:  \n  “I have seen a woman … now therefore get her for me to wife” (14:2).\n\nThus, in these few verses, Scripture lays both the divine and human sides of Samson’s story:\n\n- God’s initiative: revelation, accepted sacrifice, promised child, blessing, and the moving of the Spirit.\n- Samson’s humanity: strong desires formed by sight, expressed in urgent demand.\n\nEverything that follows in his life (beyond this passage) will grow out of this foundation: a man truly touched and moved by God, yet also a man whose choices and desires must be weighed against the holy God who appeared to his parents and blessed his birth."

        "content": "From this passage, Samson appears as a man whose whole life is rooted in a special work of God, revealed first to his parents and then seen in his own blessing and stirring by the Spirit.\n\n## 1. The holy beginning: Manoah, his wife, and the angel of the LORD (Judges 13:21–23)\n\nThe scene begins not with Samson, but with God dealing with his parents.\n\nWe read:\n\n> “But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.” (Judges 13:21)\n\nThere had been earlier appearances (implied by “did no more appear”), and only after the angel ascends (described in the earlier context) does Manoah fully grasp who has visited them. His reaction shows how weighty this encounter is:\n\n> “And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (Judges 13:22)\n\nThough the visitor is called “the angel of the LORD,” Manoah concludes, “we have seen God.” The text does not correct him; instead, the focus is on his fear. He knows enough to feel that a direct encounter with God is deadly to sinful man.\n\nBut his wife reasons from what God has just done and said:\n\n> “But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,  \n>  he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands,  \n>  neither would he have shewed us all these things,  \n>  nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.” (Judges 13:23)\n\nHer logic is simple and deeply grounded in what just happened:\n\n1. **God accepted their offerings** – “he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands.” Acceptance of sacrifice shows favour, not immediate judgment.\n2. **God has revealed things to them** – “neither would he have shewed us all these things.” Revelation is an act of mercy and purpose.\n3. **God has spoken promises** – “nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.”\n\nSo, from the very start, Samson’s life is set in a context of:\n\n- God’s **revelation** (He “shewed” and “told” them),\n- God’s **acceptance of sacrifice**, and\n- God’s **good purpose**, not destruction, for this couple.\n\nThis prepares us to see Samson not as an accident of history, but as the result of a deliberate, gracious act of God.\n\n## 2. The birth and early blessing of Samson (Judges 13:24)\n\nThe promise turns into reality:\n\n> “And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.” (Judges 13:24)\n\nThree key things are stated plainly:\n\n1. **The son is born** – God’s word to them (spoken by the angel, implied in v.23) is fulfilled.\n2. **He is named Samson** – his identity is tied to this God-given promise.\n3. **“The LORD blessed him”** – his growth is marked not just by natural development, but by the favour of the LORD.\n\nEverything about Samson’s beginning is underlined as God’s doing: the announcement, the assurance, the birth, and the blessing.\n\n## 3. The Spirit of the LORD begins to move Samson (Judges 13:25)\n\nWe then read:\n\n> “And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.” (Judges 13:25)\n\nThis shows that Samson’s significance is not merely that he is blessed generally, but that he is **stirred by the Spirit of the LORD**:\n\n- It “began” – this is the start of something ongoing.\n- It was “at times” – not continuous yet, but repeated stirrings or promptings.\n- It happened “in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol” – a specific place among his own people.\n\nSo before we see Samson do anything, the Scripture first tells us that **the Spirit of the LORD is the one who initiates and empowers** whatever his calling will involve. Samson is not introduced as a self-made strongman, but as a man **moved by God’s Spirit**.\n\n## 4. Samson’s first recorded desire: a Philistine woman (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nThe narrative then shifts from his early stirring to a specific episode in his young manhood:\n\n> “And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.” (Judges 14:1)\n\nWe are told four straightforward facts:\n\n1. He “went down to Timnath.”\n2. He “saw a woman in Timnath.”\n3. She was “of the daughters of the Philistines.”\n4. What he sees affects what he wants.\n\nThis leads directly to his request of his parents:\n\n> “And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,  \n>  I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines:  \n>  now therefore get her for me to wife.” (Judges 14:2)\n\nNotice the repetition:\n\n- Twice he says, “I have seen a woman… of the daughters of the Philistines.”\n- His desire is emphatic: **“now therefore get her for me to wife.”**\n\nSo we see a man:\n\n- already **blessed by the LORD** (13:24),\n- already **moved by the Spirit of the LORD** (13:25),\n- yet also strongly driven by what he **sees** and **desires** in a woman who is of the Philistines.\n\nThe passage does not yet evaluate this choice; it only presents it. But it clearly sets up Samson as a man whose God-given calling and personal desires will intersect within the context of Israel’s neighbours, “the Philistines.”\n\n## 5. Drawing it together: What this passage shows us about Samson\n\nFrom these verses alone, a clear picture emerges:\n\n1. **Samson is a child of divine promise and purpose.**  \n   His parents encounter the “angel of the LORD,” fear death as having “seen God” (13:22), and are reassured by evidence of God’s favour (13:23). His birth is not ordinary chance but the result of God’s revealed plan.\n\n2. **Samson’s life begins under God’s blessing.**  \n   “The child grew, and the LORD blessed him” (13:24). Before any feats of strength or failures are recorded, Scripture first wants us to see: Samson’s strength in life flows from **the LORD’s blessing**, not his own greatness.\n\n3. **Samson’s calling is by the Spirit of the LORD.**  \n   “The Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times” (13:25). Whatever we later see of Samson, this passage anchors him as a man whose role begins with the Spirit’s stirring.\n\n4. **Samson’s story will involve the Philistines and his own powerful desires.**  \n   Immediately after mentioning the Spirit moving him, the text shows him going to Timnath, fixating on a Philistine woman, and demanding her as his wife (14:1–2). The same man moved by the Spirit is also moved by his eyes and his desires.\n\nThus, even from these few verses, Samson stands before us as:\n\n- **God’s chosen and blessed son**, foretold by divine revelation,\n- **stirred by the Spirit of the LORD**, and\n- **drawn into a path involving the Philistines**, with his personal desires playing a strong role.\n\nEverything that follows in his life (beyond this passage) must be understood against this foundation: Samson is not an accident of history but a man raised up, blessed, and moved by the LORD, whose choices unfold within that divine purpose."

        "content": "Samson is introduced in Scripture at a moment of great fear, great faith, and great promise. The verses you’ve given (Judges 13:21–14:2) show his beginning: how God revealed himself to his parents, how his birth was a sign of mercy, and how the Spirit of the LORD began to work in him even before his recorded exploits.\n\nThere are no additional cross‑reference rings provided here, so we will stay within this passage and let these verses interpret one another.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Seeing God and Fearing Death (Judges 13:21–22)\n\n> “But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.  \n> And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (Judges 13:21–22)\n\nEarlier in the chapter (before the quoted section), “the angel of the LORD” had appeared to Manoah and his wife, announcing the coming birth of Samson. Here, when “the angel of the LORD did no more appear,” Manoah *finally understands* who had been speaking with them.\n\nTwo important things are linked:\n\n1. **“Angel of the LORD” and “God”**  \n   Verse 21 says he now “knew that he was an angel of the LORD,” yet in verse 22 he says, “we have seen God.” In Manoah’s mind, seeing this “angel of the LORD” means they have in some real sense seen God himself.  \n   \n   So within this passage:\n   - The **angel of the LORD** is not treated as a mere ordinary messenger.\n   - Manoah’s reaction shows the **presence and glory of God** is bound up with this appearance.\n\n2. **Fear of death from seeing God**  \n   Manoah’s conclusion is: “We shall surely die, because we have seen God” (13:22).  \n   This reflects a common biblical awareness that sinful man is not fit to behold God’s glory and live. Even without other cross‑references, the plain sense is:\n   - Manoah understands God’s holiness and his own unworthiness.\n   - He expects judgment, not mercy, because God has come near.\n\nManoah is terrified; he expects that such a holy encounter must end in their death.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Manoah’s Wife: Faith Reasoning from God’s Actions (Judges 13:23)\n\n> “But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,  \n> he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands,  \n> neither would he have shewed us all these things,  \n> nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.” (Judges 13:23)\n\nManoah’s wife answers fear with *reasoning from what God has done*:\n\n1. **“If the LORD were pleased to kill us…”**  \n   She does not deny God’s holiness or greatness, but she looks at His *recent actions* toward them as proof of His intentions.\n\n2. She gives three “would not have” arguments:\n   - “he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands”  \n     God’s acceptance of their offerings shows favor, not wrath.\n   - “neither would he have shewed us all these things”  \n     The visions and revelations they have been given are acts of mercy and purpose.\n   - “nor would as at this time have told us such things as these”  \n     God has spoken promises to them. It would contradict His own words to kill them now.\n\nHer faith rests on what God has **already** done and said. Within this passage, she interprets God’s character by His dealings:\n\n- If God meant to destroy them, He would not have:\n  - Accepted their **sacrifices**,\n  - Given them **revelation**,\n  - Spoken **promises** of what He will do.\n\nThis is important for Samson: his very existence, his birth, comes in on the back of *mercy* and *promise*, not judgment.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Birth and Blessing of Samson (Judges 13:24–25)\n\n> “And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.  \n> And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.” (Judges 13:24–25)\n\nHere we see the promised mercy fulfilled.\n\n1. **Fulfillment of the promised child**  \n   - “The woman bare a son” – exactly as the angel of the LORD had announced earlier.\n   - “and called his name Samson” – his name is tied to this miracle birth and God’s promise.\n\n2. **“The child grew, and the LORD blessed him.”**  \n   Within these words is a quiet, powerful statement:\n   - Samson’s growth is not merely natural; it is under the **blessing of the LORD**.\n   - His life from childhood is marked out as special: God’s favor is upon him.\n\n3. **The Spirit begins to move him**  \n   > “And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan…” (13:25)\n\n   Several things are taught here:\n   - **Source of his later strength and exploits**: Before we ever read of Samson’s great acts, we are told the **Spirit of the LORD** is the One moving him.\n   - **“At times”** – this indicates special stirrings or occasions, not a constant recorded manifestation, but specific movements of the Spirit.\n   - **“In the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol”** – God begins His work in Samson *among his own people*, in a specific region. His calling starts at home, amid the tribe of Dan.\n\nSo, Samson is:\n- A child **promised** by God,\n- **Blessed** by the LORD as he grows,\n- **Moved** by the Spirit of the LORD even before his public story really begins.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Samson’s Desire for a Philistine Woman (Judges 14:1–2)\n\n> “And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.  \n> And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.” (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nThese verses introduce the first recorded action of the grown Samson:\n\n1. **“Samson went down to Timnath”**  \n   - The text simply states the movement: he “went down” from his own land into a place associated with the Philistines.\n\n2. **“Saw a woman… of the daughters of the Philistines”**  \n   - His first recorded interest is not a battle, but a woman from among Israel’s enemies.\n   - The text doesn’t yet comment on whether this is right or wrong, but it clearly marks that she is “of the daughters of the Philistines,” drawing our attention to her identity as *Philistine*.\n\n3. **“Now therefore get her for me to wife”**  \n   - Samson returns to his parents and asks that they obtain her for him as a wife.\n   - This shows his strong personal desire and the beginning of a path that will involve the Philistines very closely in his life.\n\nWhen we read this right after 13:24–25, a tension appears:\n\n- On one hand: “the LORD blessed him” and “the Spirit of the LORD began to move him” (13:24–25).\n- On the other hand: “I have seen a woman… of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife” (14:2).\n\nSo the passage itself already hints that Samson is a **Spirit‑moved man with complicated desires**. God is at work in him, yet his choices will lead him into deep entanglement with the very enemies of Israel.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Putting It Together: What These Verses Teach Us About Samson\n\nStaying within these verses, we can say this about Samson and his beginning:\n\n1. **Samson’s life begins with a revelation of God’s presence.**  \n   - His parents encounter “the angel of the LORD” and say, “we have seen God” (13:21–22).\n   - His story is rooted in the holy, fearful presence of God.\n\n2. **His birth is a sign of mercy, not judgment.**  \n   - Manoah fears death; his wife reasons from God’s actions:  \n     He accepted their offerings, showed them “all these things,” and spoke promises (13:23).\n   - Therefore, Samson’s birth represents God’s **purpose to save and work**, not to destroy.\n\n3. **He is a child blessed and stirred by the LORD.**  \n   - “The child grew, and the LORD blessed him” (13:24).\n   - “The Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times” (13:25).\n   - Samson’s strength and calling are from God’s Spirit, not his own natural power alone.\n\n4. **Yet his path is not simple or pure.**  \n   - Immediately in 14:1–2, we see him drawn to a Philistine woman.\n   - The same Samson upon whom God’s Spirit moves is also led by strong personal desires that bring him into close contact with Israel’s enemies.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom Judges 13:21–14:2 alone, Samson appears as:\n\n- A **miracle child**, given by God in mercy.\n- **Blessed** and **moved** by the Spirit of the LORD from his youth.\n- Introduced at a moment when God’s presence produced fear of death, yet God’s purposes were life and deliverance.\n- A man whose God‑given calling is clear, but whose choices will intertwine his life with the Philistines.\n\nThese verses lay the foundation: Samson is God’s chosen instrument, raised up under God’s blessing and Spirit, yet he will walk a path where the holiness and purposes of God meet the weakness and desires of a man."

        "content": "This passage gives the beginning of Samson’s story and shows how his life is rooted in a direct revelation from God, in God’s acceptance of sacrifice, and in the moving of the Spirit of the LORD.\n\n## 1. The Angel of the LORD and Manoah’s Fear (Judges 13:21–22)\n\n“But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (Judges 13:21–22)\n\nFirst, we see that Manoah and his wife had been visited by “the angel of the LORD.” Only after the angel departs do they fully realize who He was: “Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.”\n\nManoah’s reaction is very strong:  \n“We shall surely die, because we have seen God.” (13:22)\n\nFrom this, the text shows:\n\n- The “angel of the LORD” they saw is so closely identified with God that Manoah equates seeing Him with seeing God Himself: “because we have seen God.”\n- Manoah believes that such a direct encounter with God’s presence means certain death. His words reveal a deep sense of God’s holiness and his own unworthiness.\n\nSo at this point, God’s revelation has produced great fear in Manoah.\n\n## 2. Manoah’s Wife: Assurance from God’s Acceptance and Promise (Judges 13:23)\n\n“But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.” (Judges 13:23)\n\nManoah’s wife answers his fear with clear, reasoned faith based on what God has actually done:\n\n1. **God accepted their offerings**  \n   “If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands...”  \n   Her argument: acceptance of their offerings shows God is not against them. If He meant to destroy them, He would not receive their sacrifices.\n\n2. **God showed them many things**  \n   “neither would he have shewed us all these things...”  \n   The visions and signs they have just experienced are evidence of God’s purpose, not His judgment.\n\n3. **God spoke promises to them**  \n   “nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.”  \n   God has actually spoken “such things as these” – words of promise about what He will do. Revealed purpose and promise are signs of grace, not impending death.\n\nSo, within the text itself, she teaches us how to read God’s actions:  \n- Accepted sacrifice  \n- Given revelation  \n- Spoken promises  \n\nThese together show that God intends life and blessing for them, not destruction.\n\n## 3. Fulfillment: Samson’s Birth and Blessing (Judges 13:24)\n\n“And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him.” (Judges 13:24)\n\nHere we see the immediate fulfillment of what God had spoken:\n\n- The woman bears a son.\n- She names him “Samson.”\n- The child grows.\n- “The LORD blessed him.”\n\nThis verse confirms the wife’s reasoning in verse 23. God did indeed intend good for them. The promised child is born, and the LORD’s blessing rests on him as he grows. So the flow is:\n\n- Revelation and promise (implied before v.21, reflected in v.23)\n- Fear (v.22)\n- Reassurance grounded in God’s actions (v.23)\n- Fulfillment and blessing (v.24)\n\nThus, Samson’s life begins as a clear work of God’s grace and promise.\n\n## 4. The Spirit of the LORD Begins to Move Samson (Judges 13:25)\n\n“And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.” (Judges 13:25)\n\nWe are then told how Samson’s life continues under God’s hand:\n\n- It is **“the Spirit of the LORD”** who begins to move him.\n- This movement happens “at times,” showing specific moments of divine stirring.\n- The location is “in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol,” placing Samson among his own people.\n\nSo, Samson is not merely naturally gifted. From the beginning, his actions are stirred by the Spirit of the LORD. His strength and role flow from God’s Spirit, not merely from himself.\n\n## 5. Samson and the Philistine Woman (Judges 14:1–2)\n\n“And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines. And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.” (Judges 14:1–2)\n\nThe next scene shows Samson as a grown man beginning to act:\n\n- He goes from his own region to **Timnath**.\n- There he “saw a woman ... of the daughters of the Philistines.”\n- He then tells his parents, repeating what he has seen, and presses them: “now therefore get her for me to wife.”\n\nThe text itself simply reports:\n\n- Samson is drawn to a Philistine woman.\n- He involves his parents to arrange the marriage.\n- This is our first recorded decision of Samson after the Spirit begins to move him.\n\nWithout other passages supplied, we do not go beyond what is here. But we can say this: the narrative moves quickly from God’s blessing and the Spirit’s stirring (13:24–25) into a situation involving the Philistines (14:1–2), setting the stage for the conflicts and events that will follow in the rest of his story.\n\n## 6. About the Rings (Cross-References)\n\nNo Ring 1, 2, or 3 passages were provided, so there are no additional KJV cross-references here to expand or confirm the teaching. All our understanding is drawn from the Anchor itself.\n\n## Summary\n\nFrom these verses alone, Samson is presented as:\n\n- A child whose birth followed a direct appearance of “the angel of the LORD,” whom Manoah identifies with having “seen God” (13:21–22).\n- A sign of God’s grace, not judgment, as Manoah’s wife reasons from:\n  - God’s acceptance of their offerings.\n  - God’s showing them “all these things.”\n  - God’s speaking “such things as these” (13:23).\n- One whom “the LORD blessed” as he grew (13:24).\n- One whom “the Spirit of the LORD began to move ... at times” in the camp of Dan (13:25).\n- A man who, as soon as we see him act as an adult, goes to Timnath, sees a Philistine woman, and insists his parents obtain her as his wife (14:1–2).\n\nThus, even from this short passage, Samson stands as a man whose life is marked by:\n- A holy and fearful encounter with God,\n- Assuring signs of God’s favor,\n- The blessing of the LORD from childhood,\n- The stirring of the Spirit of the LORD,\n- And early choices that bring him into close contact with the Philistines."

        "content": "“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)\n\nTo see how God brought this to pass, the passages you’ve provided show the *preparation* for that gift: how God preserved His Son, and how He raised up John the Baptist to prepare a people to receive Him.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Anchor: Matthew 2:20–3:4 – God prepares the way for His Son\n\n**a. God preserves and places the “young child”**\n\nMatthew 2 shows God’s careful hand over the life of Jesus:\n\n- “Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: **for they are dead which sought the young child's life**.” (Matthew 2:20)\n\nHerod had tried to destroy the child (Matthew 2:13), but God overruled. This echoes how He spoke to Moses:\n\n- “Go, return into Egypt: for **all the men are dead which sought thy life**.” (Exodus 4:19)\n\nIn both cases, God removes the threat so His saving purpose can go forward. This preservation of Christ is part of “God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son” (John 3:16). The “giving” includes:\n\n- Sending Him,\n- Guarding His life,\n- Bringing Him where He must be.\n\nJoseph then:\n\n- “took the young child and his mother, and came into the land of Israel” (Matthew 2:21),\n- but, fearing Archelaus, “he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth” (Matthew 2:22).\n\nJesus is placed in Nazareth according to prophecy (Matthew 2:22 implies v.23), showing that God’s plan to give His Son is precise and intentional.\n\n**b. John the Baptist appears: the herald of the Son**\n\nRight after we see the child settled, the very next scene is John:\n\n- “In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,  \n  And saying, **Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand**.” (Matthew 3:1–2)\n\nJohn’s ministry is not random. Matthew explains:\n\n- “For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,  \n  **The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.**” (Matthew 3:3; cf. Isaiah 40:3)\n\nSo:\n- God has brought His Son safely into Israel.\n- Now He sends a prophet to **prepare the people** to receive Him.\n\nThis is the earthly preparation for John 3:16. Before “whosoever believeth in him” can be fulfilled, the people must be called to repentance and made ready.\n\nJohn himself embodies separation and repentance:\n\n- “raiment of camel's hair, and a leathern girdle” (Matthew 3:4; Mark 1:6),\n- living in the wilderness, eating “locusts and wild honey”.\n\nA holy God is coming near; the people must be awakened and turned.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Ring 1: John’s ministry – repentance, faith, and God’s salvation for all\n\n**a. John is the promised forerunner**\n\nIsaiah had foretold:\n\n- “The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, **Prepare ye the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.**” (Isaiah 40:3)\n\nThis is directly applied to John:\n\n- “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” (Mark 1:3)\n- “As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying,  \n  The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” (Luke 3:4)\n\nLuke’s Gospel expands this, quoting more of Isaiah:\n\n- “Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;  \n  **And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.**” (Luke 3:5–6; cf. Isaiah 40:4–5)\n\n“All flesh” seeing the salvation of God matches “**God so loved the world**” (John 3:16). The scope is not limited to one class or nation.\n\nLuke 1 explains John’s calling:\n\n- “And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias… **to make ready a people prepared for the Lord**.” (Luke 1:17)\n- “And thou, child, shalt be called **the prophet of the Highest**: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways.” (Luke 1:76)\n\nSo John’s whole purpose is to **prepare people to receive the Lord**. John 3:16 says the blessing is for “whosoever believeth in him”; John’s ministry is the God-given means to bring people to that believing.\n\n**b. John’s message: repentance and faith**\n\nJohn’s core preaching is:\n\n- “**Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.**” (Matthew 3:2)\n- “John did baptize in the wilderness, and preach **the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.**” (Mark 1:4)\n- “And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.” (Luke 3:3)\n\nAnd the Lord Jesus later sums up the response demanded:\n\n- “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: **repent ye, and believe the gospel.**” (Mark 1:15)\n\nThis “repent and believe” lines up exactly with John 3:16’s “whosoever **believeth in him** should not perish.” True believing is not bare assent; it is joined with repentance and turning to God.\n\n**c. John points beyond himself to One greater**\n\nJohn is great, yet only a forerunner:\n\n- “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: **notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.**” (Matthew 11:11; cf. Luke 7:28)\n\nHe preaches:\n\n- “I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: **but he that cometh after me is mightier than I**, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear: **he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.**” (Matthew 3:11; cf. Mark 1:4,8; Luke 3:16)\n\nSo John’s whole work is preparatory. The One coming after—Jesus—is the One through whom everlasting life comes. That is exactly the One spoken of in John 3:16 as God’s “only begotten Son.”\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ring 2: The “Way” of salvation, true repentance, and the two destinies\n\n**a. God prepares a “way” and a “highway”**\n\nIsaiah enlarges the figure of “making straight” and “preparing the way”:\n\n- “And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called **The way of holiness**; the unclean shall not pass over it.” (Isaiah 35:8)\n- “Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain:  \n  And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and **all flesh shall see it together**.” (Isaiah 40:4–5)\n- “And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall be exalted.” (Isaiah 49:11)\n- “Cast ye up, cast ye up, **prepare the way**, take up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.” (Isaiah 57:14)\n- “Go through, go through the gates; **prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway**; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.” (Isaiah 62:10)\n\nJohn’s “Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight” (Matthew 3:3) sits right in this stream. God Himself is providing a **way** by which sinners can come to Him. John 3:16 states that way plainly: **God gave His Son**, and whoever believes in Him has everlasting life.\n\n**b. True repentance: confession, change, and fruit**\n\nJohn does not allow a shallow response:\n\n- People “were baptized of him in Jordan, **confessing their sins**.” (Matthew 3:6; cf. Mark 1:5)\n- He warns the religious:  \n  “O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?  \n  **Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance**:  \n  And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father…” (Matthew 3:7–9; cf. Luke 3:7–9)\n\nLuke records practical examples of such “fruits”:\n\n- Share with the needy (Luke 3:11),\n- No extortion (Luke 3:13),\n- No violence or false accusation; be content with wages (Luke 3:14).\n\nThis aligns with the older calls of God:\n\n- “If they shall **confess their iniquity**…” (Leviticus 26:40)\n- “I acknowledged my sin unto thee… I said, **I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest**…” (Psalms 32:5)\n- “Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings… **learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed…**” (Isaiah 1:16–17)\n\nAnd the New Testament confirms:\n\n- “For **godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation** not to be repented of…” (2 Corinthians 7:10–11)\n\nSo the “believeth in him” of John 3:16 is of this kind: a believing that comes with repentance, confession, and a turning of heart and life toward God.\n\n**c. The two destinies: perish or life**\n\nJohn preaches in terms of coming **wrath** and **fire**:\n\n- “who hath warned you to **flee from the wrath to come**?” (Matthew 3:7; Luke 3:7)\n- “every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is **hewn down, and cast into the fire**.” (Matthew 3:10; Luke 3:9)\n- “he will throughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will **burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.**” (Matthew 3:12)\n\nThat is the “perishing” side of John 3:16: the righteous judgment of God.\n\nThis pattern of **escape vs. destruction** is seen earlier:\n\n- Noah “did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.” (Genesis 7:5; cf. 6:22) He escaped the flood by obedient faith.\n- Lot was told: “**Escape for thy life**… **escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.**” (Genesis 19:17) To stay was to perish; to flee was to live.\n\nJohn’s question—“who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?”—picks up this very language. In John 3:16, God Himself is the One who has provided that escape: by giving His Son, so that “whosoever believeth in him **should not perish, but have everlasting life.**”\n\n**d. “Whosoever”: sinners and nations included**\n\nJohn’s ministry reached unlikely people:\n\n- “Then went out to him **Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan, And were baptized of him…**” (Matthew 3:5–6)\n- Jesus later says, “publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you… For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but **the publicans and the harlots believed him**…” (Matthew 21:31–32)\n\nIsaiah had also said of the Servant:\n\n- “I will also give thee for **a light to the Gentiles**, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the earth.” (Isaiah 49:6)\n\nAnd Jesus Himself testifies:\n\n- “many shall come from the east and west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 8:11)\n\nThis prepares us to understand John 3:16’s “**world**” and “**whosoever**”: not just the religious elite, not only physical Israel, but all sorts—Jews, Gentiles, publicans, harlots—any who repent and believe in God’s Son.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ring 3: Christ publicly marked out as the giver of life\n\nMatthew 3 closes with Jesus Himself coming to John:\n\n- “Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be baptized of him.” (Matthew 3:13)\n\nJohn protests:\n\n- “I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?” (Matthew 3:14)\n\nJesus answers:\n\n- “Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us **to fulfil all righteousness.** Then he suffered him.” (Matthew 3:15)\n\nThen God openly sets His seal on Jesus:\n\n- “And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, **the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him.**” (Matthew 3:16)\n\nHere is the One of whom John had said:\n\n- “he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire.” (Matthew 3:11; Luke 3:16)\n\nSo the Father, the Spirit, and the forerunner together testify that **this Jesus** is the divinely appointed giver of the Spirit and the divider between wheat and chaff. He is exactly the One of whom it is written:\n\n- “that whosoever believeth in **him** should not perish, but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Drawing it together: John 3:16 in this light\n\nPutting these strands together:\n\n- **God’s love**: He preserves the life of His Son (Matthew 2:20–22), fulfils prophecy, and sends a forerunner (John) to prepare hearts (Isaiah 40:3; Matthew 3:1–3; Luke 1:17,76).\n- **God’s gift**: Jesus is His “only begotten Son” (John 3:16), marked out at His baptism by the descent of the Spirit (Matthew 3:16) and heralded as the Mightier One who baptizes with the Holy Ghost (Matthew 3:11).\n- **The human response**: John preaches “repent” and “believe” (Matthew 3:2; Mark 1:15); people confess sins (Matthew 3:6); true repentance bears fruit (Matthew 3:8; Luke 3:8–14).\n- **The scope**: “All flesh shall see the salvation of God” (Luke 3:6); God gives His Servant “for a light to the Gentiles” (Isaiah 49:6); even publicans and harlots enter before the self‑righteous (Matthew 21:31–32). This harmonizes with “God so loved **the world**… that **whosoever** believeth…”\n- **The outcome**: Those who refuse to repent and believe face “the wrath to come,” the tree “cast into the fire,” and the chaff burned “with unquenchable fire” (Matthew 3:7,10,12). Those who flee to God’s provided escape, as Noah and Lot did (Genesis 6:22; 7:5; 19:17–20), do **not perish**, but live.\n\nThus, through these passages, Scripture itself shows that John 3:16 is God’s own summary of this whole work:\n\n- In love, He **gave His Son**.\n- Through John, He **prepared a people** by calling them to repentance and faith.\n- Through His Son, He offers **forgiveness, the Holy Ghost, and everlasting life** to all who truly believe,\n- That they might escape the wrath to come and know the salvation God promised from of old."

Anchor Passage: Salmon in Ruth 4\n\nRuth closes by tracing the family line that leads to David:\n\n> “And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he *is* the father of Jesse, the father of David.” (Ruth 4:17)\n\nThen Scripture steps back and gives the wider lineage:\n\n> “Now these *are* the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,  \n> And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,  \n> And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat **Salmon** \\[Salmah\\],  \n> And **Salmon begat Boaz**, and Boaz begat Obed,  \n> And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.” (Ruth 4:18–22)\n\nFrom this, we learn exactly who Salmon is:\n\n- He is the **son of Nahshon**: “Nahshon begat Salmon” (Ruth 4:20).  \n- He is the **father of Boaz**: “And Salmon begat Boaz” (Ruth 4:21).  \n- Through Boaz, he is an **ancestor of David**:  \n  Salmon → Boaz → Obed → Jesse → David (Ruth 4:21–22).\n\nSo, in this passage, “Salmon” (also noted as “Salmah”) is a **link in the God-ordained ancestral chain** that leads to David, the king.\n\n## 2. How the Surrounding Verse (1 Samuel 1:1) Confirms the Pattern\n\nThe only other verse given is 1 Samuel 1:1:\n\n> “Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount Ephraim, and his name *was* Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:” (1 Samuel 1:1)\n\nThis doesn’t mention Salmon, but it shows the **same biblical pattern** we see in Ruth 4:\n\n- A man is introduced by **name**.\n- His **fathers** are listed in order: “the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph”.\n- His **place** and identity are tied to his lineage (“of mount Ephraim … an Ephrathite”).\n\nJust as Elkanah is identified and grounded in his family line, so Salmon is identified and grounded in his line in Ruth 4. Both passages show that **God records people in Scripture by their place in His unfolding purpose through generations.**\n\n## 3. Summary\n\nFrom the text you’ve provided, we can say this about Salmon, and no more:\n\n- Salmon is a real historical man named in the “generations of Pharez” (Ruth 4:18).  \n- He is the son of Nahshon (Ruth 4:20).  \n- He is the father of Boaz (Ruth 4:21).  \n- Through Boaz, he is an ancestor of David (Ruth 4:21–22).  \n\nThus, in this passage, *“Salmon” is a key ancestor in the line that God used to bring forth David*, and his main biblical role here is to mark his place in that God-ordered genealogy."

Anchor Passage – Who were Noah’s sons?\n\nIn the genealogy leading up to Noah, we read:\n\n> “And Lamech lived after he begat **Noah** five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters…  \n> And Noah was five hundred years old: and **Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth**.”  \n> (Genesis 5:30, 32)\n\nSo the three sons of Noah are:\n\n- **Shem**  \n- **Ham**  \n- **Japheth**\n\n## 2. Ring 1 – Confirming and showing their role\n\nThis is repeated and confirmed:\n\n> “And Noah begat three sons, **Shem, Ham, and Japheth**.” (Genesis 6:10)\n\nWhen the flood came and the ark was entered:\n\n> “In the selfsame day entered **Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah**, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, into the ark;” (Genesis 7:13)\n\nPeter sums this up:\n\n> “...in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, **eight souls** were saved by water.” (1 Peter 3:20)\n\nThose eight were: Noah, his wife, his three sons (Shem, Ham, Japheth), and their three wives.\n\nAfter the flood:\n\n> “And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were **Shem, and Ham, and Japheth**: and Ham is the father of Canaan.  \n> **These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole earth overspread.**”  \n> (Genesis 9:18–19)\n\nSo Scripture teaches plainly that:\n\n- Noah had **three** named sons: Shem, Ham, Japheth.\n- After the flood, **“of them was the whole earth overspread”** (Genesis 9:19) – all post‑flood humanity comes from these three.\n\nThis is confirmed again in the genealogies:\n\n> “Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.” (1 Chronicles 1:4)\n\nAnd in Christ’s genealogy:\n\n> “...which was the son of **Sem, which was the son of Noe, which was the son of Lamech**,” (Luke 3:36)\n\nHere “Sem” is Shem, showing that the line of Christ comes through **Shem**, the son of Noah.\n\n## 3. Ring 2 – Their families after the flood\n\nGenesis 10 begins:\n\n> “Now these are the generations of **the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth**: and unto them were sons born after the flood.” (Genesis 10:1)\n\nThen the chapter lists the descendants of each:\n\n- Sons of **Ham**: “Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.” (Genesis 10:6)  \n- Sons of **Shem** are listed further:  \n  > “The sons of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram…” (1 Chronicles 1:17; cf. Genesis 10:21–31)\n\nThus Scripture shows a clear line:\n\n- **Noah → Shem, Ham, Japheth → all the nations after the flood.**\n\n## 4. Ring 1 detail – The different words spoken over the sons\n\nAfter the incident where Noah awoke from his wine:\n\n> “And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.” (Genesis 9:24)\n\nThen Noah speaks concerning his sons, especially in relation to **Canaan**, the son of Ham:\n\n> “And he said, **Cursed be Canaan**; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.  \n> And he said, **Blessed be the LORD God of Shem**; and Canaan shall be his servant.  \n> God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.”  \n> (Genesis 9:25–27)\n\nSo:\n\n- **Shem** is especially associated with “the LORD God of Shem.”\n- **Japheth** is to be enlarged and “dwell in the tents of Shem.”\n- **Canaan**, from **Ham**, is prophesied to be servant to his brethren.\n\nScripture does not go beyond this in the passages you provided, but it shows that Noah’s three sons each have a distinct place in God’s unfolding purposes.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nNoah’s sons, as the KJV clearly states, are **Shem, Ham, and Japheth** (Genesis 5:32; 6:10; 7:13; 9:18–19). From these three, “was the whole earth overspread” after the flood (Genesis 9:19), and their descendants form the families and nations listed in Genesis 10."

        "content": "The phrase “Sermon on the Mount” usually points us to the Lord Jesus’ teaching in Matthew 5–7.  \nThe Scriptures laid before us, however, centre on another great “sermon” from God: the flood in the days of Noah (Genesis 7).  \n\nThe amazing thing is that Jesus Himself *uses* this very event in His later preaching (Matthew 24; Luke 17), to warn about His coming—so the flood story becomes part of His message, just as surely as the Sermon on the Mount.\n\nLet’s walk through the passage and its connections, then see how it functions as a living sermon from God, in harmony with Christ’s own preaching.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Anchor: Genesis 7:17–23 – A World Drowned, A Few Saved\n\nIn Genesis 7 we are not given vague imagery but a concrete, historical judgment.\n\nThe waters do exactly what God had said they would do:\n\n> “And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the earth.” (Genesis 7:17)\n\nThe language in the anchor passage piles up to stress **extent** and **totality**:\n\n- “the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the earth” (7:18)  \n- “all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered” (7:19)  \n- “Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the mountains were covered.” (7:20)\n\nSo the highest points of human security—“the mountains”—are no refuge when God rises to judge.\n\nThen the Spirit underlines *who* perished:\n\n> “And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing… and every man:  \n> All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died.” (Genesis 7:21–22)\n\nAnd again, in sweeping summary:\n\n> “And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground… and they were destroyed from the earth: **and Noah only remained alive, and they that were with him in the ark.**” (Genesis 7:23)\n\nSo the anchor passage preaches a very clear message:\n\n1. God’s judgment was **universal** (“all the high hills… were covered,” “every living substance was destroyed”).\n2. God’s judgment was **particular**: it fell on “all flesh” that breathed on the dry land (7:21–22).\n3. Salvation was **exclusive**: “Noah only… and they that were with him in the ark” (7:23).\n\nAlready we see the outlines of a sermon: sin brings certain judgment; the whole world is not too large for God to reach; and there is only one God-appointed place of safety.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Ring 1 – God Meant It, Warned of It, and Did It\n\nRing 1 takes us back to the divine warnings and forward to how later Scripture remembers this event.\n\nFirst, God had plainly announced this judgment:\n\n> “And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, **to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life**, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.” (Genesis 6:17)\n\n> “For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and **every living substance that I have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth**.” (Genesis 7:4; cf. 7:12)\n\nWhat He foretold, He performed. Job sums up God’s sovereign rule over waters:\n\n> “Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: **also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.**” (Job 12:15)\n\nThe flood was no accident of nature; it was the out-sent, earth-overturning judgment of God.\n\nJob 22 connects that flood to the *wickedness* of those men:\n\n> “Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?  \n> Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:  \n> Which said unto God, **Depart from us**: and what can the Almighty do for them?” (Job 22:15–17)\n\nSo the “old way” is a way of conscious rejection: “Depart from us.” The flood was God’s answer to a world that wanted nothing to do with Him.\n\nThe Psalms remember how complete that covering was:\n\n> “Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: **the waters stood above the mountains.**” (Psalms 104:6)\n\nAnd yet even those mighty waters fled at His rebuke (104:7–8), showing that He not only sends judgment, but also sets its bounds.\n\nThe New Testament confirms the historical, moral, and prophetic character of the flood:\n\n- God “spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood **upon the world of the ungodly**” (2 Peter 2:5).\n- “The world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished” (2 Peter 3:6).\n\nAnd this is precisely the event the Lord Jesus uses in His preaching:\n\n> “…and **knew not** until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.” (Matthew 24:39)\n\n> “They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, **and destroyed them all.**” (Luke 17:27)\n\nHere Jesus turns the historical flood into a **warning sermon** about His own coming:  \nordinary life, spiritual blindness, then sudden, total judgment.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ring 2 – Why the Flood Came, and What It Foreshadows\n\nRing 2 reveals **why** this terrible judgment was sent and how God dealt with Noah.\n\nGod had formed man “of the dust of the ground” and “breathed into his nostrils the breath of life” (Genesis 2:7). But in Noah’s day:\n\n> “GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that **every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually**.” (Genesis 6:5)\n\n> “And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth…” (Genesis 6:7)\n\n> “The end of all flesh is come before me; for **the earth is filled with violence** through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.” (Genesis 6:13)\n\nYet God is not quick-tempered. He says:\n\n> “My spirit shall not always strive with man… yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.” (Genesis 6:3)\n\nThis matches Peter’s testimony:\n\n> “…the longsuffering of God **waited in the days of Noah**, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.” (1 Peter 3:20)\n\nAnd Noah in that time is “a preacher of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5). So before the waters fell, there were:\n\n- God’s **Spirit striving** (Genesis 6:3),\n- God’s **preaching through Noah** (2 Peter 2:5),\n- God’s **longsuffering waiting** (1 Peter 3:20),\n- and God’s **specific warning** (Genesis 6:17; 7:4).\n\nBut a day came when the warnings ended:\n\n> “In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life… the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened” (Genesis 7:11).  \n> “In the selfsame day entered Noah… into the ark…  \n> And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him: **and the LORD shut him in.**” (Genesis 7:13–16)\n\nThere is a decisive divine act: *the LORD shut him in*. The door of mercy, long open, is finally closed.\n\nJesus uses the same picture when He warns:\n\n> “When once the master of the house is risen up, and **hath shut to the door**, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are:” (Luke 13:25)\n\nThe flood story thus preaches what Jesus preaches:  \nthere is a day when the door shuts, and late religion cannot enter.\n\nRing 2 also lifts our eyes from the past flood to a future, greater upheaval:\n\n> “…by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water…  \n> But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, **reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.**” (2 Peter 3:5,7)\n\nThe old world perished by water (3:6). The present world is reserved for **fire**. And:\n\n> “The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night…” (2 Peter 3:10)\n\nThat is exactly the note Jesus strikes in His preaching about His coming (cf. Matthew 24:39’s “knew not”).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ring 3 – The Final Shaking and the Call to Holiness\n\nRing 3 broadens this even further to a full cosmic shaking.\n\nIsaiah describes the earth under judgment:\n\n> “Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein are desolate… and few men left.” (Isaiah 24:6)  \n> “The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.” (Isaiah 24:19)\n\nAmos, Micah, Nahum, and the Psalms describe creation melting and trembling:\n\n> “…it shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.” (Amos 9:5)\n\n> “The mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys shall be cleft, as wax before the fire…” (Micah 1:4)\n\n> “The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence…” (Nahum 1:5)\n\n> “The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.” (Psalms 97:5)\n\nPeter gathers this all up:\n\n> “…the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.  \n> Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, **what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness**,  \n> Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God…” (2 Peter 3:10–12)\n\nAnd John is given the final scene:\n\n> “And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face **the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.**” (Revelation 20:11)\n\nIn that light, the voice of Christ comes again:\n\n> “Behold, I come as a thief. **Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments**, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.” (Revelation 16:15)\n\nNotice how this matches the picture in Luke 17:\n\n- People are absorbed with this life—“They did eat, they drank, they married…” (Luke 17:27; cf. 17:26).\n- Like the rich man in Luke 12 who says, “Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry” (Luke 12:19).\n- But judgment falls suddenly, and only those who are *watching* and *ready* are blessed (Revelation 16:15).\n\n---\n\n## 5. So How Does This Relate to the “Sermon on the Mount”?\n\nThe Scriptures given do not take us directly to Matthew 5–7, but they do show us how the same Lord who preached the Sermon on the Mount *also* preached using Noah’s flood.\n\nFrom these texts, we see that:\n\n- The flood itself is a **sermon from God**: exposing human wickedness (Genesis 6:5), displaying His longsuffering (1 Peter 3:20), and then His sure judgment (Genesis 7:17–23).\n- Noah is called “a preacher of righteousness” (2 Peter 2:5). His whole life and obedience proclaimed what God would later make explicit in His own preaching: God requires righteousness.\n- Jesus draws directly on this history in His preaching about His coming: people were busy, indifferent, and “knew not until the flood came” (Matthew 24:39). “So shall also the coming of the Son of man be.”\n- The apostles then extend that warning: as surely as the old world perished by water (2 Peter 3:6), this present world will face a final judgment by fire (2 Peter 3:7,10), calling us to “all holy conversation and godliness” (2 Peter 3:11).\n\nSo when you read the Sermon on the Mount, with its call to true righteousness and a life that will stand in the day of testing, this flood narrative and its echoes are the backdrop.  \n\nThe message running through all these passages is the same:\n\n- God’s patience is real, but not endless (Genesis 6:3; 1 Peter 3:20).\n- Judgment is certain and often sudden (Genesis 7:11–12; Matthew 24:39; Luke 17:27; 2 Peter 3:10).\n- Outward normality is no proof of safety; men can be eating, drinking, marrying, building—and perishing (Luke 17:26–27; Luke 12:19).\n- Blessed are those who heed God’s word **now**, enter His appointed refuge while the door is open (Genesis 7:16; Luke 13:25), and live in watchful holiness (2 Peter 3:11–12; Revelation 16:15).\n\nThus, the flood in Genesis 7, the warnings of Jesus in Matthew 24 and Luke 17, the apostolic teaching in Peter, and the final visions in Revelation all preach a united sermon:  \n\nHear God’s word, turn from ungodliness, live in holiness and watchfulness—  \nfor the same Lord who once covered the mountains with water will again shake heaven and earth, and only those who are “in” His provision will stand."

        "content": "The “Sermon on the Mount” is the extended teaching of the Lord Jesus that begins when He sits down on the mountain and “opened his mouth, and taught them” (Matthew 5:1–2). The verses you’ve given (Matthew 4:23–5:4) show **how He prepares for that sermon, who He is speaking to, and the first things He says**.  \n\nBelow, we’ll walk from the Anchor Passage outward and let the other Scriptures explain it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Setting: The King Preaching and Healing (Matthew 4:23–25)\n\nBefore Jesus speaks a word of the Sermon, Matthew shows what He is already doing:\n\n> “And Jesus went about all Galilee, **teaching in their synagogues**, and **preaching the gospel of the kingdom**, and **healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people**.” (Matthew 4:23)\n\nThree things stand together:\n\n1. **Teaching** – in the synagogues (the regular gathering places for Scripture and instruction; cf. Psalms 74:8).\n2. **Preaching** – specifically “the gospel of the kingdom.”\n3. **Healing** – “all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.”\n\nThis pattern is repeated later:\n\n> “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, **teaching** in their synagogues, and **preaching the gospel of the kingdom**, and **healing every sickness and every disease among the people**.” (Matthew 9:35)  \n\nSo when the Sermon on the Mount begins in chapter 5, it is not an isolated lecture. It is the **authoritative teaching of the same One who is already displaying the power of the kingdom** in both word and deed.\n\n### Healing and Forgiving: God at Work in Christ\n\nWhat kind of healing is this? Scripture links it with **God’s own work**:\n\n> “Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; **who healeth all thy diseases**;” (Psalms 103:3)  \n> “He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.” (Psalms 107:20)  \n> “He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.” (Psalms 147:3)\n\nIn the Gospels, this healing is tied directly to Jesus’ mission and to prophecy:\n\n> “When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and **healed all that were sick**:  \n> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, **Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses**.” (Matthew 8:16–17)\n\nIsaiah had foretold this ministry:\n\n> “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to **preach good tidings unto the meek**; he hath sent me to **bind up the brokenhearted**, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;” (Isaiah 61:1)\n\nJesus applies this to Himself:\n\n> “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to **preach the gospel to the poor**; he hath sent me to **heal the brokenhearted**, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to **set at liberty them that are bruised**,” (Luke 4:18)\n\nSo when Matthew 4:24 says:\n\n> “they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils… and he healed them.” (Matthew 4:24)\n\nwe are seeing the **fulfillment of God’s promises**: the Lord who “healeth thee” (Exodus 15:26), who “healeth the broken in heart” (Psalms 147:3), is now at work in His Christ.\n\nAnd much more than physical healing is in view:\n\n> “Son, be of good cheer; **thy sins be forgiven thee**.” (Matthew 9:2)  \n> “Wherefore I say unto thee, **Her sins, which are many, are forgiven**… And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven…. Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.” (Luke 7:47–50)\n\nThe One who teaches in Matthew 5 is the One who brings **both forgiveness and healing**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Message: “The Gospel of the Kingdom” and Repentance\n\nMatthew 4:23 calls Jesus’ message “the gospel of the kingdom.” Just before this, Matthew summarizes that message:\n\n> “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, **Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.**” (Matthew 4:17)\n\nThis echoes John the Baptist:\n\n> “And saying, **Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.**” (Matthew 3:2)\n\nAnd it matches how the Gospel of Mark sums up Jesus’ preaching:\n\n> “Jesus came into Galilee, **preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God**,  \n> And saying, **The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye, and believe the gospel.**” (Mark 1:14–15)\n\nLater, Jesus sends His disciples out with **the same kingdom message**:\n\n> “And as ye go, preach, saying, **The kingdom of heaven is at hand.** Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.” (Matthew 10:7–8)  \n> “And he sent them to **preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick**.” (Luke 9:2)  \n> “And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, **The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you.**” (Luke 10:9–11)\n\nSo the Sermon on the Mount is **kingdom preaching**. It tells us **who really belongs to this kingdom**, and what kind of people are “blessed” in God’s sight.\n\nEntry into that kingdom is tied to **repentance**—a turning to God with sorrow over sin:\n\n> “For **godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation** not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)  \n> “I am not come to call the righteous, but **sinners to repentance**.” (Matthew 9:13)  \n> “And that **repentance and remission of sins** should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” (Luke 24:47)\n\nThis background is vital as Jesus begins His Sermon by pronouncing **blessing** on certain people.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Audience and the Mountain (Matthew 4:25–5:2)\n\nBecause of His teaching, preaching, and healing, **great crowds** gather:\n\n> “And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.” (Matthew 4:25)\n\nThen:\n\n> “And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, **his disciples came unto him**:  \n> And he opened his mouth, and **taught them**, saying…” (Matthew 5:1–2)\n\nSo:\n\n- The **multitudes** draw the scene.\n- But **He addresses His disciples** directly.\n\nLuke describes a parallel setting where people come “to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases” (Luke 6:17), then:\n\n> “And he lifted up his eyes on **his disciples**, and said, **Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.**” (Luke 6:20)\n\nThus, the Sermon on the Mount (and its parallel in Luke 6) is especially directed to **those who follow Him**, but in the hearing of the crowds.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The First Beatitude: “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (Matthew 5:3)\n\n> “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:3)\n\nLuke’s parallel:\n\n> “Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.” (Luke 6:20)\n\nThe phrase “poor in spirit” is explained by many Scriptures that describe the kind of heart God regards:\n\n> “but to this man will I look, even to him that is **poor and of a contrite spirit**, and trembleth at my word.” (Isaiah 66:2)  \n> “The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a **broken heart**; and saveth such as be of a **contrite spirit**.” (Psalms 34:18)  \n> “The sacrifices of God are a **broken spirit**: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.” (Psalms 51:17)  \n> “For thus saith the high and lofty One… I dwell in the high and holy place, **with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit**, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.” (Isaiah 57:15)\n\nThe **“poor in spirit”** are those who:\n\n- Know their spiritual need.\n- Are humbled, broken, contrite before God.\n- Tremble at His word, rather than trusting in their own righteousness.\n\nWe see an example in Jesus’ parable:\n\n> “And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, **God be merciful to me a sinner.**” (Luke 18:13)\n\nSuch a person is spiritually “poor,” yet **this** is the one God receives. Jesus says of them:\n\n> “for **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**.” (Matthew 5:3)\n\nThis matches so many of His later statements:\n\n> “Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.” (Matthew 21:31)  \n\nWhy? Because when they heard John and Jesus, **they repented** (Matthew 21:31–32), whereas the proud religious leaders did not.\n\nSo the Sermon on the Mount begins by **overturning worldly ideas of who is “blessed.”** Not the self-satisfied religious, but the spiritually needy who come to God in humility.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Second Beatitude: “Blessed are they that mourn” (Matthew 5:4)\n\n> “Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.” (Matthew 5:4)\n\nAgain, Luke sheds light:\n\n> “Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.” (Luke 6:21)  \n> “Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.” (Luke 6:25)\n\nThis mourning is not merely natural sorrow, but fits with:\n\n- **Godly sorrow** leading to repentance (2 Corinthians 7:10).\n- The broken-hearted whom the Lord heals (Psalms 147:3; Isaiah 61:1).\n- Those turning back to God under His chastening:\n\n> “Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.” (Hosea 6:1)  \n> “I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and **restore comforts unto him and to his mourners**.” (Isaiah 57:18)\n\nThe Lord is near such people:\n\n> “The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart…” (Psalms 34:18)\n\nJesus says they “shall be comforted.” This comfort includes:\n\n- **Present healing and forgiveness** (as seen in His ministry: Matthew 9:2; Luke 7:47–50).\n- **Future joy and reward**:\n\n  > “Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, your **reward is great in heaven**…” (Luke 6:23)  \n  > “Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for **great is your reward in heaven**: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” (Matthew 5:12)  \n  > “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and **eternal weight of glory**;” (2 Corinthians 4:17)\n\nThus, those who **mourn now**—over sin, over suffering for Christ, over the broken condition of this world—are promised deep, certain comfort from God.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Blessing and Woe: The Great Reversal (Luke 6:20–26)\n\nLuke’s parallel teaching makes the contrast explicit:\n\n> “Blessed be ye poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.  \n> Blessed are ye that hunger now: for ye shall be filled. Blessed are ye that weep now: for ye shall laugh.  \n> Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you… for the Son of man’s sake. Rejoice ye in that day… for, behold, your reward is great in heaven…” (Luke 6:20–23)\n\nBut then:\n\n> “But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.  \n> Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger.  \n> Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.  \n> Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.” (Luke 6:24–26)\n\nThis shines light back on the Sermon on the Mount:\n\n- Those who appear **blessed now**—rich, full, laughing, praised—may face future **woe**, if their hearts are not poor, repentant, and obedient to God.\n- Those who **suffer now**—poor, hungry, weeping, hated for Christ’s sake—are **truly blessed**, with great reward in heaven.\n\nThis matches Jesus’ word:\n\n> “Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake: for **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**.” (Matthew 5:10)  \n> “Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for **great is your reward in heaven**: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” (Matthew 5:12)  \n> “But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are **partakers of Christ’s sufferings**; that, when his glory shall be revealed, **ye may be glad also with exceeding joy**.” (1 Peter 4:13)\n\nSo the Sermon on the Mount sets forth a **heavenly estimation** of blessing—completely different from man’s.\n\n---\n\n## 7. True Righteousness vs. Hypocrisy\n\nWithin this larger sermon, Jesus also exposes false religion. One glimpse of this is:\n\n> “And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the **hypocrites** are: for they love to pray **standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men**. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.” (Matthew 6:5)\n\nThis agrees with His later rebuke:\n\n> “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye **shut up the kingdom of heaven against men**: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.” (Matthew 23:13)\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount, from the very first Beatitudes, draws a line between:\n\n- **The humble, broken, repentant**, who are truly blessed and have the kingdom.\n- **The proud, outwardly religious, self-confident**, who are warned of woe, exclusion, and judgment.\n\nAgain, Jesus says publicans and harlots go into the kingdom before the religious leaders, because the former **repented** (Matthew 21:31–32), while the latter “repented not.”\n\n---\n\n## 8. The Golden Thread: The Sermon’s Place in God’s Plan\n\nPulling the strands together:\n\n- In the Old Testament, God repeatedly shows regard for **the poor and contrite in spirit**, the brokenhearted, those who mourn and return to Him (Psalms 34:18; 51:17; 57:15; 147:3; Isaiah 57:15,18; 61:1; 66:2; Hosea 6:1).\n- He promises to **heal**, to **bind up**, to **comfort**.\n- Jesus comes preaching, “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matthew 4:17), healing all manner of sickness and disease, forgiving sins, fulfilling Isaiah’s promises.\n- Great multitudes follow; He goes up into a mountain, His disciples come to Him, and He **begins His Sermon** with these words:\n  - “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:3)\n  - “Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.” (Matthew 5:4)\n- Luke’s parallel adds the balancing **woes** and underscores that the real dividing line is not outward condition but **heart posture toward God and His Son** (Luke 6:20–26).\n\nThis same message continues after His resurrection:\n\n> “And that **repentance and remission of sins** should be preached in his name **among all nations**…” (Luke 24:47)  \n\nAnd heaven rejoices when this happens:\n\n> “joy shall be in heaven over **one sinner that repenteth**…” (Luke 15:7,10)\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount begins with the King of heaven, already preaching and demonstrating **the gospel of the kingdom**, sitting down to teach His disciples what kind of people are truly **blessed**.\n\nAccording to Jesus:\n\n- The **poor in spirit**—the contrite, broken, spiritually needy—are blessed, for **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**.\n- Those who **mourn now**—in godly sorrow, in suffering, in faithfulness to Him—are blessed, for **they shall be comforted**.\n- Those who are **persecuted for righteousness’ sake** and for the Son of man’s sake are blessed, for **their reward is great in heaven**.\n\nThis sermon perfectly matches the whole witness of Scripture: God draws near to the contrite, heals the brokenhearted, calls sinners to repentance, and promises eternal comfort and glory to those who suffer with Christ.\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount, therefore, is **the King’s description of the citizens of His kingdom**—people marked not by outward success, but by inward humility, repentance, and a hope fixed on the reward “in heaven” that He Himself gives."

The Setting: Preaching the Kingdom and Healing the Broken\n\nBefore Jesus ever goes up into the mountain to teach, Matthew shows what He has been doing:\n\n> “And Jesus went about all Galilee, **teaching in their synagogues**, and **preaching the gospel of the kingdom**, and **healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people**.” (Matthew 4:23)\n\nThis threefold pattern—teaching, preaching the kingdom, and healing—is repeated again:\n\n> “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, **teaching** in their synagogues, and **preaching the gospel of the kingdom**, and **healing every sickness and every disease among the people**.” (Matthew 9:35)\n\nSo when the sermon on the mount begins, it comes **after** a season of widespread preaching and healing:\n\n> “And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him **all sick people** that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.  \n> And there followed him **great multitudes** of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.” (Matthew 4:24–25)\n\nThese miracles are not random; they fulfil what God had promised:\n\n> “Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; **who healeth all thy diseases**;” (Psalm 103:3)  \n> “I am the LORD **that healeth thee**.” (Exodus 15:26)  \n> “He sent his word, and **healed** them, and delivered them from their destructions.” (Psalm 107:20)\n\nMatthew ties Jesus’ healings directly to prophecy:\n\n> “When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and **healed all that were sick**:  \n> That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, **Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses**.” (Matthew 8:16–17)\n\nIsaiah had foretold this:\n\n> “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me **to preach good tidings unto the meek**; **he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted**, to proclaim liberty to the captives…” (Isaiah 61:1)  \n\nJesus applies this to Himself:\n\n> “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me **to preach the gospel to the poor**; he hath sent me **to heal the brokenhearted**, to preach deliverance to the captives…” (Luke 4:18)\n\nSo when we come to the sermon on the mount, we are watching the One who:\n\n- Preaches “the gospel of the kingdom,” and  \n- Heals bodies and hearts as the promised Healer.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Audience and Beginning of the Sermon\n\nAfter the description of the multitudes, Matthew says:\n\n> “And seeing the multitudes, **he went up into a mountain**: and when he was set, **his disciples came unto him**:  \n> And he opened his mouth, and **taught them**, saying,” (Matthew 5:1–2)\n\nLuke gives a parallel scene on another occasion:\n\n> “And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of **his disciples**, and a great multitude of people… which came **to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases**;” (Luke 6:17)\n\nAnd Luke shows that, though the crowds are there, He is especially addressing His disciples:\n\n> “And he **lifted up his eyes on his disciples**, and said, Blessed be **ye** poor: for **yours is the kingdom of God**.” (Luke 6:20)\n\nSo the sermon on the mount is **teaching for disciples**, spoken in the hearing of the multitudes.\n\n---\n\n## 3. “Blessed are the poor in spirit” – Who belongs to the kingdom?\n\nThe first word of the sermon is “Blessed”:\n\n> “Blessed are **the poor in spirit**: for **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**.” (Matthew 5:3)\n\nLuke’s parallel says:\n\n> “Blessed be ye **poor**: for **yours is the kingdom of God**.” (Luke 6:20)\n\nThe question is: who are these “poor in spirit”?\n\nScripture consistently defines the ones God favours as the **humble, contrite, broken-hearted**:\n\n> “but to this man will I look, even to him that is **poor and of a contrite spirit**, and trembleth at my word.” (Isaiah 66:2)  \n> “The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a **broken heart**; and saveth such as be of a **contrite spirit**.” (Psalm 34:18)  \n> “The sacrifices of God are a **broken spirit**: a **broken and a contrite heart**, O God, thou wilt not despise.” (Psalm 51:17)  \n> “I dwell… with him also that is of a **contrite and humble spirit**, to **revive** the spirit of the humble, and to **revive** the heart of the contrite ones.” (Isaiah 57:15)\n\nJesus illustrates such a person in a parable:\n\n> “And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, **God be merciful to me a sinner**.” (Luke 18:13)\n\nThat man is “poor in spirit”—he has nothing to boast of, no spiritual riches of his own, only a cry for mercy.\n\nNow notice how this fits with the message of Jesus and John before the sermon:\n\n> “And saying, **Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand**.” (Matthew 3:2)  \n> “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, **Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand**.” (Matthew 4:17)  \n> “And as ye go, preach, saying, **The kingdom of heaven is at hand**.” (Matthew 10:7)  \n> “The time is fulfilled, and **the kingdom of God is at hand**: **repent ye, and believe the gospel**.” (Mark 1:15)\n\nThe “poor in spirit” are those who **respond to this call to repent**—they see their spiritual poverty and bow before God. They are the ones to whom the King says, “theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”\n\nThis also explains Jesus’ later words:\n\n> “…the publicans and the harlots **go into the kingdom of God before you**.” (Matthew 21:31)  \n\nWhy? Because, as He says there, they believed John’s call to repentance, while the religious leaders “repented not afterward” (Matthew 21:32). The gate into the kingdom is not religious pride, but spiritual poverty and repentance.\n\nBy contrast, Luke records the corresponding **woes**:\n\n> “But **woe unto you that are rich!** for ye have received your consolation.” (Luke 6:24)\n\nNot that wealth itself is condemned, but **self-sufficiency**—those who are “rich” in their own eyes, who feel no need, have their comfort now and miss the kingdom.\n\nSo the first beatitude in the sermon on the mount declares: **the truly blessed are those who are spiritually low, humble, and contrite before God**. To them belongs the kingdom.\n\n---\n\n## 4. “Blessed are they that mourn” – Godly sorrow and divine comfort\n\nThe second beatitude follows:\n\n> “Blessed are **they that mourn**: for **they shall be comforted**.” (Matthew 5:4)\n\nLuke parallels this with:\n\n> “Blessed are ye that **weep now**: for ye shall laugh.  \n> **Woe unto you that laugh now!** for ye shall mourn and weep.” (Luke 6:21, 25)\n\nThis is more than general sadness. In the context of repentance and spiritual poverty, Scripture speaks of **godly sorrow**:\n\n> “For **godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation** not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)\n\nAnd of those whom God has wounded, and then heals:\n\n> “Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for **he hath torn, and he will heal us**; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.” (Hosea 6:1)  \n> “For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: **he woundeth, and his hands make whole**.” (Job 5:18)\n\nThe prophets also link mourning with those God will comfort:\n\n> “I have seen his ways, and **will heal him**: I will lead him also, and **restore comforts unto him and to his mourners**.” (Isaiah 57:18)\n\nAnd again:\n\n> “He healeth the **broken in heart**, and bindeth up their wounds.” (Psalm 147:3)\n\nThis “mourning” is the grief of those who:\n\n- Are broken over their sin,  \n- Are burdened under affliction,  \n- Cry to the LORD in their trouble (Psalm 107:19–20).\n\nSuch mourners are **blessed**, Jesus says, “for they shall be comforted.” That comfort comes:\n\n1. **Now**, through forgiveness and peace with God:  \n   - “Son, be of good cheer; **thy sins be forgiven thee**.” (Matthew 9:2)  \n   - “Her sins, which are many, **are forgiven**… And he said unto her, **Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace**.” (Luke 7:47–50)\n\n2. **In the world to come**, through joy and glory:  \n   - “Rejoice ye in that day, and leap for joy: for, behold, **your reward is great in heaven**…” (Luke 6:23)  \n   - “Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for **great is your reward in heaven**…” (Matthew 5:12)  \n   - “For our **light affliction**, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a **far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory**;” (2 Corinthians 4:17)  \n   - “…when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also **with exceeding joy**.” (1 Peter 4:13)\n\nSo the second beatitude declares: **those who truly grieve in a godly way—over sin and suffering, drawing them to God—will have the deep comfort of His healing, forgiveness, and final joy.**\n\n---\n\n## 5. Miracles and Message Together – The Kingdom in Word and Power\n\nThe sermon on the mount is not a bare moral code. It stands in the midst of Jesus’ **kingdom preaching and healing**.\n\nEverywhere He goes, He does the same:\n\n> “Now when the sun was setting, **all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him**; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.” (Luke 4:40)  \n> “And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and **was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick**.” (Matthew 14:14)\n\nHe then sends His disciples to do likewise:\n\n> “And as ye go, preach, saying, **The kingdom of heaven is at hand**. **Heal the sick**, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.” (Matthew 10:7–8)  \n> “And he sent them to **preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick**.” (Luke 9:2)  \n> “And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, **The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you**.” (Luke 10:9)\n\nThe miracles are visible signs that:\n\n- The King is present,  \n- The promised time has arrived:  \n  > “The law and the prophets were until John: since that time **the kingdom of God is preached**, and every man presseth into it.” (Luke 16:16)\n\nBut His greater work is **forgiveness and repentance**:\n\n> “…I am not come to call the righteous, but **sinners to repentance**.” (Matthew 9:13)  \n> “And that **repentance and remission of sins** should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” (Luke 24:47)\n\nThus the sermon on the mount begins by describing the kind of people who actually receive this kingdom salvation:\n\n- **Poor in spirit** – contrite, humble, knowing their need.  \n- **Mourning** – grieved in a godly way, turning to God.  \n- Later in the same sermon:  \n  > “Blessed are they which are **persecuted for righteousness’ sake**: for **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**.” (Matthew 5:10)  \n  > “Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so **persecuted they the prophets** which were before you.” (Matthew 5:12)\n\nLuke matches this with:\n\n> “Blessed are ye, when men shall **hate you**, and when they shall separate you… for the Son of man's sake. **Rejoice ye in that day**, and leap for joy: for, behold, your reward is great in heaven…” (Luke 6:22–23)\n\nSo from the start, the sermon on the mount shows that the truly blessed are those who, though lowly, sorrowing, and even persecuted, **receive the kingdom now and glory hereafter**.\n\n---\n\n## 6. In Summary: What This Portion of the Sermon on the Mount Teaches\n\nPutting it together from these Scriptures:\n\n1. **The context**: Jesus has been **preaching the gospel of the kingdom** and **healing** all manner of sickness (Matthew 4:23–25; 9:35), fulfilling God’s promises to heal and to bind up the brokenhearted (Psalm 103:3; Isaiah 61:1; Luke 4:18).\n\n2. **The audience**: His **disciples** come to Him, with multitudes listening (Matthew 5:1–2; Luke 6:17,20). The sermon is teaching for those who would follow Him as King.\n\n3. **The message**: The very first beatitudes declare who is truly “blessed” and who “has” the kingdom:\n   - **“Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.”** (Matthew 5:3)  \n   These are the humble, contrite, spiritually needy ones (Isaiah 66:2; Psalm 51:17; Luke 18:13) who respond to the call to **repent** as the kingdom draws near (Matthew 3:2; 4:17; Mark 1:15).\n   - **“Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.”** (Matthew 5:4)  \n   These are those who grieve in **godly sorrow** (2 Corinthians 7:10), whose broken hearts God heals and to whom He restores comforts (Isaiah 57:15,18; Psalm 147:3). Their comfort is forgiveness now and eternal joy to come (Matthew 5:12; Luke 6:21–23; 2 Corinthians 4:17).\n\n4. **The great reversal**: The poor, hungry, and weeping who look to God are blessed; those who are rich, full, and laughing now, but without repentance, face woe (Luke 6:20–25).\n\nSo, in this opening of the sermon on the mount, the Lord Jesus sets the tone for all that follows: **the kingdom of heaven belongs not to the self-righteous, but to the broken, repentant, lowly, and faithful—even when they suffer.** These are the ones whom God calls “blessed,” and to whom He promises His kingdom, His comfort, and His eternal reward."

        "content": "The Sermon on the Mount begins where your Anchor Passage leaves off. Matthew shows us **what Jesus is doing**, then **what Jesus says**.\n\n## 1. The Setting: The King, His Kingdom, and His Works (Matthew 4:23–25)\n\nBefore Jesus ever sits down to teach, Matthew shows three things together:\n\n1. **Teaching in their synagogues**\n2. **Preaching the gospel of the kingdom**\n3. **Healing all manner of sickness and disease**\n\n> “And Jesus went about all Galilee, **teaching in their synagogues**, and **preaching the gospel of the kingdom**, and **healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease** among the people.” (Matthew 4:23)\n\nThis pattern repeats:\n\n> “And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, **teaching** in their synagogues, and **preaching the gospel of the kingdom**, and **healing every sickness and every disease** among the people.” (Matthew 9:35)\n\nSo the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5–7) is the **teaching** that goes with the **gospel of the kingdom**, confirmed by His **mighty works of healing**.\n\nThese healings are not random; they fulfil Scripture:\n\n> “When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils… and he healed all that were sick: **That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our sicknesses.**” (Matthew 8:16–17)\n\nThis reflects Old Testament truths about the LORD:\n\n> “Who **forgiveth all thine iniquities**; who **healeth all thy diseases**;” (Psalm 103:3)  \n> “I am the LORD **that healeth thee**.” (Exodus 15:26)  \n> “He sent his word, and **healed** them, and **delivered** them from their destructions.” (Psalm 107:20)\n\nIsaiah had prophesied of One anointed to preach and to heal:\n\n> “The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to **preach good tidings unto the meek**; he hath sent me to **bind up the brokenhearted**, to proclaim liberty to the captives…” (Isaiah 61:1)\n\nJesus applies this to Himself:\n\n> “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to **preach the gospel to the poor**; he hath sent me to **heal the brokenhearted**, to preach deliverance to the captives…” (Luke 4:18)\n\nSo when we come to the mountain, we are seeing:\n\n- The One who **forgives iniquities and heals diseases** (Psalm 103:3).\n- The One who **heals the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds** (Psalm 147:3).\n- The One who **preaches the gospel to the poor** (Luke 4:18).\n\nAnd what is His message called?\n\n> “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, **Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.**” (Matthew 4:17; cf. Matthew 3:2; Matthew 10:7; Mark 1:14–15)\n\nThe **Sermon on the Mount** is kingdom teaching spoken to those called by this message of repentance.\n\n## 2. The Audience and the Mountain (Matthew 5:1–2)\n\n> “And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, **his disciples came unto him**: And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,” (Matthew 5:1–2)\n\nThere are **great multitudes** (Matthew 4:25), but Matthew notes **“his disciples came unto him”**. Luke’s parallel shows the same mixture:\n\n> “And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of **his disciples**, and a **great multitude of people**… which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;” (Luke 6:17)\n\nSo the sermon is:\n\n- Spoken **to disciples** first.\n- In the hearing of **great multitudes**.\n- As part of His **kingdom preaching** and **healing ministry**.\n\nThe Beatitudes that open the sermon describe the **character and condition of those who belong to this kingdom**.\n\n## 3. “Blessed are the poor in spirit” (Matthew 5:3)\n\n> “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for **theirs is the kingdom of heaven**.” (Matthew 5:3)\n\nLuke gives a parallel:\n\n> “And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed **be ye poor**: for **yours is the kingdom of God**.” (Luke 6:20)\n\nMatthew says **“poor in spirit”**; Luke says **“ye poor”**. Scripture interprets Scripture: the emphasis is on those who are **lowly**, **needy**, and **spiritually humbled** before God.\n\nThe Old Testament describes the kind of person to whom the LORD looks:\n\n> “But to this man will I look, even to him that is **poor and of a contrite spirit**, and trembleth at my word.” (Isaiah 66:2)  \n> “The sacrifices of God are a **broken spirit**: a broken and a **contrite heart**, O God, thou wilt not despise.” (Psalm 51:17)  \n> “The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a **broken heart**; and saveth such as be of a **contrite spirit**.” (Psalm 34:18)  \n> “For thus saith the high and lofty One… I dwell… with him also that is of a **contrite and humble spirit**, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.” (Isaiah 57:15)\n\nThis “poverty of spirit” is not material poverty alone, but **humble, repentant lowliness before God**.\n\nThe New Testament gives living examples:\n\n- The **publican** in Luke 18:13:\n\n  > “And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, **God be merciful to me a sinner.**” (Luke 18:13)\n\n- The **publicans and harlots** who believed John:\n\n  > “Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.  \n  > For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him…” (Matthew 21:31–32)\n\nThese “poor in spirit” are those who:\n\n- Hear the call: **“Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”** (Matthew 4:17)\n- Respond with **brokenness**, not self-righteousness.\n- Trust themselves to God’s mercy.\n\nIn contrast:\n\n> “But woe unto you **that are rich!** for ye have received your consolation.” (Luke 6:24)  \n> “But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye **shut up the kingdom of heaven against men**: for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.” (Matthew 23:13)\n\nThose who are **self-satisfied, outwardly religious, and inwardly proud** are not the “poor in spirit.” They shut themselves out of the very kingdom they see.\n\nThus Matthew 5:3 declares: the **kingdom of heaven** belongs not to the self-sufficient, but to the **spiritually bankrupt who come to God in true humility and repentance**.\n\n## 4. “Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted” (Matthew 5:4)\n\n> “Blessed are they that mourn: for **they shall be comforted**.” (Matthew 5:4)\n\nLuke parallels this:\n\n> “Blessed are ye that **weep now**: for **ye shall laugh**.” (Luke 6:21)  \n> “Woe unto you that **laugh now!** for **ye shall mourn and weep.**” (Luke 6:25)\n\nThere is a **now / later** contrast:\n\n- Those who **weep now** (in this life) are promised future **comfort and joy**.\n- Those who **laugh now** in a worldly, self-satisfied way will face future **mourning and weeping**.\n\nScripture connects **mourning** closely with **repentance** and **godly sorrow**:\n\n> “For godly sorrow worketh **repentance to salvation** not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world worketh death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)\n\nThis godly sorrow is the cry:\n\n> “Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.” (Hosea 6:1)\n\nThe Lord Himself speaks:\n\n> “I have seen his ways, and **will heal him**: I will lead him also, and **restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.**” (Isaiah 57:18)\n\nSo “they that mourn” are:\n\n- Those who grieve over **sin and its effects**.\n- Those who, under affliction and conviction, **cry unto the LORD**:\n\n  > “Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.  \n  > He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.” (Psalm 107:19–20)\n\n- Those who suffer **for righteousness’ sake** and for Christ:\n\n  > “Blessed are they which are **persecuted for righteousness' sake**: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” (Matthew 5:10)  \n  > “Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for **great is your reward in heaven**: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.” (Matthew 5:12)  \n  > “Blessed are ye, when men shall hate you… for the Son of man's sake.” (Luke 6:22)\n\nTo such mourners, God promises **comfort**:\n\n- **Now**, by His presence with the contrite:\n\n  > “The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart…” (Psalm 34:18)\n\n- **Now**, through forgiveness and peace:\n\n  See the woman in Luke 7: She weeps at Jesus’ feet (mourning over her sins); Jesus says:\n\n  > “Her sins, which are many, are forgiven…  \n  > And he said unto her, **Thy sins are forgiven.** …  \n  > And he said to the woman, **Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.**” (Luke 7:47–50)\n\n- **In the future**, in glory:\n\n  > “For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, **worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory**;” (2 Corinthians 4:17)  \n  > “But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings; that, **when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.**” (1 Peter 4:13)\n\nLuke captures this future joy:\n\n> “Rejoice ye in that day, and **leap for joy**: for, behold, **your reward is great in heaven**: for in the like manner did their fathers unto the prophets.” (Luke 6:23)\n\nThus, in the Sermon on the Mount, **mourning** is not cursed, but **blessed**—when it is mourning in repentance and in suffering for righteousness. Such mourners are promised **divine comfort and eternal joy**.\n\n## 5. The Golden Thread: Repentance, the Kingdom, and True Blessedness\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- The **message** Jesus and His forerunner John preach is:  \n  > “Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.” (Matthew 3:2; 4:17; 10:7; Mark 1:15)\n\n- This message is joined with **healing** and power:  \n  > “The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk… the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and **the poor have the gospel preached to them.**” (Matthew 11:5; cf. Luke 7:22)\n\n- Jesus then sends His disciples out with the same pattern:  \n  > “And as ye go, preach, saying, **The kingdom of heaven is at hand.**  \n  > **Heal the sick**, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely ye have received, freely give.” (Matthew 10:7–8; cf. Luke 9:2; 10:9–11; Mark 6:12)\n\nThe Sermon on the Mount, beginning with:\n\n> “Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.  \n> Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.” (Matthew 5:3–4)\n\nis the Lord’s description of the **true subjects of this kingdom**:\n\n- They are **poor and contrite in spirit**, not proud and self-satisfied.\n- They **mourn**—over sin, and under suffering for Christ—and are promised **comfort**.\n- They are often **despised now**, but their **reward is great in heaven** (Matthew 5:12; Luke 6:23).\n- They are the ones to whom the Lord draws near, heals, revives, and finally glorifies (Isaiah 57:15, 18; Psalm 147:3; 2 Corinthians 4:17).\n\nSo, the Sermon on the Mount opens by turning the world’s idea of “blessed” upside down. In the eyes of Jesus:\n\n- The spiritually broken, not the self-righteous, are blessed.  \n- The mourners, not the comfortable mockers, are blessed.  \n- The persecuted, not the praised by all men, are blessed (Luke 6:22–26).\n\nAnd all of this is anchored in the **gospel of the kingdom** He is preaching and proving by His works:\n\n> “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: **repent ye, and believe the gospel.**” (Mark 1:15)\n\nTo hear the Sermon on the Mount rightly is to see ourselves as **poor in spirit**, to **mourn** where God calls sin “sin,” and to cast ourselves upon the mercy of the One who **forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases** (Psalm 103:3). To such He says: **“theirs is the kingdom of heaven… they shall be comforted.”**"

The world Cain and Abel were born into: driven from life\n\nBefore we meet Cain and Abel, the Bible shows us Adam and Eve cast out of Eden:\n\n> “And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, **lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever**:  \n> Therefore the LORD God **sent him forth from the garden of Eden**, to till the ground from whence he was taken.  \n> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword… to keep the way of the tree of life.” (Genesis 3:22–24)\n\nEarlier, God had commanded:\n\n> “But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: **for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die**.” (Genesis 2:17)\n\nAfter they eat, God says to Adam:\n\n> “cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;  \n> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee…  \n> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground… for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” (Genesis 3:17–19)\n\nSo, when Cain and Abel are born:\n\n- Humanity **knows good and evil**, but is **separated from the tree of life** (Genesis 3:22).  \n- The **ground is cursed**, work is hard, and death is certain (Genesis 3:17–19).  \n- Man can no longer simply reach out and take eternal life by his own act (Genesis 3:22–24).\n\nThis is the world in which Cain and Abel appear.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Cain and Abel: sons of Adam, workers under the curse\n\nThen we read:\n\n> “And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.  \n> And she again bare his brother Abel. **And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.**” (Genesis 4:1–2)\n\nThey are sons of Adam, who himself was created:\n\n> “in the likeness of God made he him” (Genesis 5:1; cf. 1:26–27).\n\nSo Cain and Abel, as Adam’s sons, are part of humanity made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26–27; 5:1), now living east of Eden, under the curse.\n\nTheir occupations match the creation mandate:\n\n> “Let us make man in our image… and let them have **dominion** over the fish… fowl… cattle… and over all the earth” (Genesis 1:26).  \n> “Thou madest him to have **dominion over the works of thy hands**; thou hast put all things under his feet:  \n> All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;  \n> The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea…” (Psalms 8:6–8).\n\nAbel, “a keeper of sheep” (Genesis 4:2), exercises dominion over animals.  \nCain, “a tiller of the ground” (Genesis 4:2), works the earth.\n\nBoth callings are legitimate. Scripture honours both:\n\n- God “causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth **food out of the earth**” (Psalms 104:14).  \n- “Moreover **the profit of the earth is for all**: the king himself is served by the field.” (Ecclesiastes 5:9).\n\nYet Cain’s work is especially tied to the **cursed ground** (Genesis 3:17–18). Later, after his sin, God says to him:\n\n> “When thou tillest the ground, **it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength**; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.” (Genesis 4:12)\n\nSo Cain’s entire life and identity are bound up with a ground already under curse, and then, because of his later sin, even more against him.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Their offerings: how they approach God\n\nIn that fallen world, both brothers bring offerings:\n\n> “And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of **the fruit of the ground** an offering unto the LORD.  \n> And Abel, he also brought of **the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof**. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering.” (Genesis 4:3–4)\n\nNotice a few plain points:\n\n1. **Both** come to the LORD with offerings. Worship is still possible outside Eden.\n2. Each brings what matches his calling:\n   - Cain – “fruit of the ground”\n   - Abel – “firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof”\n3. God’s evaluation is clear on one side:\n   - “the LORD **had respect unto Abel and to his offering**” (Genesis 4:4).\n\nField work itself is not despised—Scripture says the earth’s profit is for all (Ecclesiastes 5:9). So the problem is not that Cain worked the soil.\n\nBut Abel’s offering is described as:\n\n- “firstlings” – the first-born of the flock  \n- “and of the fat thereof” – the richest part\n\nSo Abel brings the **first and the best** of what he has. His offering aligns with the spirit of the “meek” who seek the LORD:\n\n> “The meek shall eat and be satisfied: **they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.**” (Psalms 22:26)\n\nAbel’s offering is joined to seeking and honouring God. God looks not only at the gift, but at the worshipper—“the LORD had respect unto Abel and to his offering” (Genesis 4:4).\n\nBy contrast, Scripture later shows that Cain’s life leads to judgment (Genesis 4:12, 25). His problem is not his trade, but his *heart and way* before God. This fits the broader witness of Scripture:\n\n> “Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; **but they have sought out many inventions.**” (Ecclesiastes 7:29)\n\n> “For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness… Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted thee…” (Isaiah 47:10)\n\nWorldly wisdom and self-will twist the heart away from God. Abel comes in meek worship; Cain’s way becomes the opposite.\n\n---\n\n## 4. From disobedience to murder: sin growing in Adam’s race\n\nThe Fall began with a promise of false wisdom:\n\n> “For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and **ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil**.” (Genesis 3:5)\n\nAfter eating, God Himself says:\n\n> “Behold, the man is become as one of us, **to know good and evil**…” (Genesis 3:22)\n\nSo mankind **knows** good and evil, but that knowledge has not made him godly. Instead, it has led to exile, toil, and death.\n\nVery soon that corruption shows itself in Cain. We are not given all the steps in the verses here, but we are told the outcome plainly:\n\n> “…For God, said she, hath appointed me another seed instead of Abel, **whom Cain slew.**” (Genesis 4:25)\n\nCain becomes the first murderer in Scripture. And this is especially terrible because humans bear God’s image:\n\n> “Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: **for in the image of God made he man.**” (Genesis 9:6)\n\nAbel is not just killing “a person” in the abstract; he is killing one made in God’s image, a worshipper whose offering God accepted.\n\nFor that, Cain’s relationship to the ground—already cursed because of Adam—is further judged:\n\n> “When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength; **a fugitive and a vagabond** shalt thou be in the earth.” (Genesis 4:12)\n\nThe soil that was meant to serve man (Psalms 104:14; Ecclesiastes 5:9) now refuses its strength to Cain. Creation itself testifies against his sin.\n\nAll this fits the wider pattern the Scriptures describe:\n\n- People trust in their own wisdom, which God makes foolish:\n\n  > “Where is the wise? … hath not God **made foolish the wisdom of this world?**  \n  > For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God…” (1 Corinthians 1:20–21)\n\n  > “For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God…” (1 Corinthians 3:19)\n\n- People walk according to “the course of this world”:\n\n  > “Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air…  \n  > Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh… and were by nature **the children of wrath**…” (Ephesians 2:2–3)\n\nCain is an early example of this path: knowing good and evil, yet walking in evil, even to the point of killing his brother.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Abel, Cain, and Seth: two ways and a preserved seed\n\nAfter Abel’s death, Eve says:\n\n> “For God, said she, hath appointed me **another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.**” (Genesis 4:25)\n\nAbel, the man whose offering God respected, is cut down. Yet God “appoints” another seed—Seth—to continue the line.\n\nThis fits God’s purpose for mankind:\n\n- He made man in His likeness (Genesis 5:1; 1:26–27).\n- Though man corrupts his way (Ecclesiastes 7:29), God remains the Maker and Potter:\n\n  > “But now, O LORD, thou art our father; **we are the clay, and thou our potter**; and we all are the work of thy hand.” (Isaiah 64:8)  \n  > “Know ye that the LORD he is God: **it is he that hath made us**, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.” (Psalms 100:3)\n\nSo in Abel and Cain we see two paths:\n\n- Abel – meek, God-honouring worship; God “had respect unto Abel and to his offering” (Genesis 4:4).  \n- Cain – goes on to murder his brother; becomes a fugitive and a vagabond (Genesis 4:12, 25).\n\nIn Seth, we see God preserving a **seed** despite sin: His purpose for a people who belong to Him will stand.\n\n---\n\n## 6. From the lost tree of life to the promised tree of life\n\nCain and Abel live in a world shut out from the tree of life:\n\n> God “placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword… **to keep the way of the tree of life**.” (Genesis 3:24)\n\nHumans may not reach out and seize eternal life on their own terms.\n\nBut Revelation shows **the tree of life opened again**, not to all indiscriminately, but to those who come God’s way:\n\n> “To him that overcometh will I give **to eat of the tree of life**, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.” (Revelation 2:7)\n\n> “…on either side of the river, was there **the tree of life**, which bare twelve manner of fruits… and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.” (Revelation 22:2)\n\n> “Blessed are they that do his commandments, **that they may have right to the tree of life**, and may enter in through the gates into the city.” (Revelation 22:14)\n\nThe contrast is sharp:\n\n- In Genesis, man tries to take forbidden fruit (Genesis 3:6) and is then barred from the tree of life (Genesis 3:22–24).\n- In Revelation, those who **overcome** and **do his commandments** are freely given the tree of life.\n\nPsalms connects this with the heart posture of the meek:\n\n> “The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: **your heart shall live for ever.**” (Psalms 22:26)\n\nAbel’s accepted offering, in meekness and seeking God, points toward this way of life from God’s hand—not seizing wisdom or life on our own terms (as in Genesis 3), but receiving what He gives to those who trust and obey.\n\nCain, on the other hand, stands in the line of those who follow the “course of this world” (Ephesians 2:2), whose wisdom God frustrates (Isaiah 44:25; 1 Corinthians 1:20), and who end in death.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Christ and the restoration of the image and life\n\nAt creation, man is made in God’s image (Genesis 1:26–27; 5:1). In Cain and Abel, that image-bearing humanity is already divided: one worshipper pleasing to God, the other a murderer.\n\nThe New Testament tells us that the true and perfect **image of God** is Christ:\n\n> “the glorious gospel of Christ, **who is the image of God**…” (2 Corinthians 4:4)\n\nAnd God works through Christ to renew His people:\n\n> “For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, **to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.**” (2 Corinthians 4:6)\n\n> “But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are **changed into the same image from glory to glory**, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (2 Corinthians 3:18)\n\n> “For we are **his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works**, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.” (Ephesians 2:10)\n\nWhat Adam lost, and what is so tragically twisted in Cain, is restored in Christ:\n\n- We are made **new creations**, God’s workmanship.  \n- We are changed back into God’s image in holiness.  \n- We are set to walk, not in Cain’s works of wrath, but in “good works” (Ephesians 2:10).\n\nThus the call is:\n\n> “…let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, **as unto a faithful Creator.**” (1 Peter 4:19)\n\nAbel, though slain, represents those who entrust themselves to God and whose “heart shall live for ever” (Psalms 22:26). Cain represents those who, knowing good and evil, still choose evil.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary\n\nPutting it all together from the Scriptures you provided:\n\n- Cain and Abel are the first sons of Adam and Eve, born **outside Eden**, under the curse on the ground and the sentence of death (Genesis 3:17–19; 4:1–2).\n- Both live out the creation mandate in different vocations: Abel over sheep, Cain over the ground (Genesis 4:2; Psalms 8:6–8).\n- Both bring offerings, but **God has respect to Abel and to his offering**—he brings the first and the best of his flock, in a spirit that matches the meek who seek God (Genesis 4:3–4; Psalms 22:26).\n- Cain later **kills Abel** (Genesis 4:25), shedding the blood of one made in God’s image (Genesis 9:6), and is further judged in his work with the earth (Genesis 4:12).\n- Abel and Cain picture two ways: humble, God-honouring worship that leads to life from God, and self-willed, sinful life that leads to judgment.\n- God preserves His purpose by appointing **another seed**, Seth, instead of Abel (Genesis 4:25), showing that His plan for a godly line will stand.\n- Though the tree of life is barred in Genesis (Genesis 3:22–24), God promises access to it again in Revelation for those who overcome and keep His commandments (Revelation 2:7; 22:2,14).\n- In Christ, the true image of God (2 Corinthians 4:4), God shines light into hearts and recreates a people in His image, to walk in good works instead of Cain’s way (2 Corinthians 3:18; 4:6; Ephesians 2:10).\n\nSo the story of Cain and Abel is an early, powerful picture of how fallen mankind responds to God: either like Abel, in meek, God-honouring worship that leads to life, or like Cain, in self-will and sin that ends in judgment. And it points us forward to Christ, the faithful image of God and the giver of access to the tree of life once more."

        "content": "In the Scriptures you’ve given, the “Saul” in view is **not** the New Testament Saul whose name is later Paul, but an **Edomite king** in the line of Esau. And the “Pau” that appears nearby is not a person, but the **name of a city**. So in this passage, “Saul to Pau” is not about a conversion, but about the rise and fall of earthly kings in Edom.\n\nLet’s trace that carefully from the text.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Anchor: Saul of Rehoboth and the city Pau (Genesis 36)\n\nGenesis 36 records the generations of **Esau**, who is **Edom** (Gen 36:1,8), and especially the kings who reigned in his land:\n\n> “And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom, **before there reigned any king over the children of Israel**.” (Genesis 36:31)\n\nIn your anchor verses we read a sequence of Edomite kings:\n\n- “And Samlah died, and **Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.**  \n  And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his stead.  \n  And Baalhanan… died, and Hadar reigned in his stead: **and the name of his city was Pau**…” (Genesis 36:37–39)\n\nSo:\n\n- **Saul** here is “Saul of Rehoboth by the river,” a king in Edom.\n- **Pau** is the city of the last listed king, Hadar (also called Hadad in 1 Chronicles 1:50).\n\nNothing in this passage suggests a man whose name changes from Saul to Paul. Instead, the text is emphasizing a **chain of mortal kings**: *“and X died, and Y reigned in his stead.”* Their power is temporary.\n\nVerse 40 then shifts from kings to **dukes (chiefs)** of Esau:\n\n> “And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,” (Genesis 36:40)\n\nSo Genesis 36 is showing that **Esau’s line becomes a full nation with kings and dukes**—real political power in the earth.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Ring 1: Confirming the Edomite line and Saul of Rehoboth\n\n1 Chronicles 1 repeats this same list, confirming the identity of this Saul:\n\n> “And when Samlah was dead, **Shaul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.** … And when Baalhanan was dead, Hadad reigned in his stead: and the name of his city was **Pai**…” (1 Chronicles 1:48, 50)\n\n“Pau” in Genesis 36:39 and “Pai” in 1 Chronicles 1:50 are variant spellings of the **same city**. Again, we see Saul followed, in the line of Edom’s kings, by a king whose **city** is Pau/Pai.\n\nThe name **Rehoboth** itself ties back to early empire-building:\n\n> “Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded **Nineveh**, and the city **Rehoboth**, and Calah,” (Genesis 10:11)\n\nSo “Rehoboth by the river” (Saul’s origin) echoes the same name as a city connected with early **Assyria** and **Nineveh**—large centers of human power.\n\nExodus 15:15 then looks ahead and speaks of **Edom’s leaders** reacting in fear when God delivers Israel:\n\n> “Then the **dukes of Edom shall be amazed**; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.” (Exodus 15:15)\n\nSo the kings and dukes in Genesis 36 (including Saul) belong to the very people whose rulers will later **tremble** at the power of the LORD.\n\nWe also see a personal connection: **Eliphaz the Temanite**, Job’s friend, is from Esau’s line:\n\n- “And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.” (Genesis 36:11)  \n- “Now when Job’s three friends heard of all this evil… they came every one from his own place; **Eliphaz the Temanite**…” (Job 2:11)\n\n“Teman” is a descendant of Esau; so even in the book of Job, Esau’s family line appears again.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Ring 2: Two nations from the womb – Esau’s kings and Israel’s king\n\nGod had already spoken of **Esau and Jacob** to Rebekah:\n\n> “Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels… and the elder shall serve the younger.” (Genesis 25:23)\n\nEsau is the elder; Jacob the younger. Esau’s line becomes **Edom** with its kings and dukes. Jacob’s line becomes **Israel**.\n\nGod had also promised Abraham and Sarah:\n\n- “And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make **nations** of thee, and **kings** shall come out of thee.” (Genesis 17:6)  \n- “And I will bless her… she shall be a mother of nations; **kings of people shall be of her.**” (Genesis 17:16)\n\nThis promise of **kings** includes not only Israel, but also other lines from Abraham. Of Ishmael, God said:\n\n> “I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly; **twelve princes shall he beget**, and I will make him a great nation.” (Genesis 17:20)\n\nGenesis 36 shows that this broader promise is being fulfilled: **Esau**, too, produces dukes and kings in Edom. They are real nations, real rulers.\n\nBut for **Israel**, God sets a very different standard for kingship:\n\n> “When thou art come unto the land… and shalt say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations…  \n> Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose…  \n> But he shall not multiply horses to himself…  \n> Neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.  \n> And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his kingdom, that he shall **write him a copy of this law**…  \n> And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn **to fear the LORD his God**…”  \n> (Deuteronomy 17:14–19)\n\nIsrael’s kingship is to be **under God’s law**, humble, not trusting in horses, wealth, and worldly power. Later the LORD Himself is described as king:\n\n> “And he was **king in Jeshurun**, when the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together.” (Deuteronomy 33:5)\n\nThis contrasts sharply with the pattern in Edom: no mention of God’s law, only the cycle: “and X died, and Y reigned in his stead.”\n\n---\n\n## 4. Ring 2–3: The rise and ruin of proud nations (Edom, Assyria, Nineveh)\n\nThe line of Esau grows strong, but the prophets show that **Edom’s might will be broken**:\n\n- “But I will send a fire upon **Teman**, which shall devour the palaces of **Bozrah**.” (Amos 1:12)\n- “And thy mighty men, O **Teman**, shall be dismayed, to the end that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by slaughter.” (Obadiah 1:9)\n- “For thy **violence against thy brother Jacob** shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.” (Obadiah 1:10)\n\nIsaiah speaks of judgment on **Idumea** (Edom) and specifically on **Bozrah**, a key Edomite city:\n\n> “For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon **Idumea**, and upon the people of my curse, to judgment.  \n> … for the LORD hath a sacrifice in **Bozrah**, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.” (Isaiah 34:5–6)\n\nLater, the LORD Himself is pictured coming from this very region in judgment:\n\n> “Who is this that cometh from **Edom**, with dyed garments from **Bozrah**? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? **I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.**  \n> Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winefat?  \n> I have trodden the winepress alone… for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury…” (Isaiah 63:1–3)\n\nSo the same Edomite world (of which Saul of Rehoboth and Hadar of Pau are a part) will one day face **the LORD’s vengeance**.\n\nSimilarly, the city **Rehoboth** and its world partner **Nineveh** (Genesis 10:11) rise to great power in **Assyria**, but they too are judged:\n\n- “The burden of **Nineveh**. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.” (Nahum 1:1)\n- “But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away… Nineveh is laid waste…” (Nahum 2:8; 3:7)\n\nThe prophets repeatedly warn against trusting in such worldly strength:\n\n- “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.” (Psalms 20:7)\n- “Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and **stay on horses, and trust in chariots**, because they are many… but they look not unto the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!” (Isaiah 31:1)\n- “Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses flesh, and not spirit…” (Isaiah 31:3)\n- “Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses… for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.” (Hosea 14:3)\n\nAll of this describes the **spirit of the nations** like Edom and Assyria: strong, armed, apparently secure—yet under the judgment of God. Psalm 37:35 fits this pattern:\n\n> “I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.” (Psalms 37:35)\n\nAnd yet, like the repeated “and X died, and Y reigned,” their greatness is **brief**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Ring 3: Two lines of kings – Esau’s and David’s, ending in Christ\n\nGenesis emphasizes that God’s purpose is not only that there be many nations, but that out of Abraham and Jacob should come a **chosen line of kings**:\n\n- “I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a **company of nations** shall be of thee, and **kings** shall come out of thy loins;” (Genesis 35:11)\n\nMatthew 1 then traces this royal line:\n\n> “And Jesse begat **David the king**; and David the king begat Solomon…  \n> …And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born **Jesus, who is called Christ**.  \n> So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen… and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.” (Matthew 1:6–17)\n\nSo Scripture sets side by side:\n\n- The **kings of Edom** (Esau’s line)—including Saul of Rehoboth and Hadar of Pau—who rise and fall, and at last face judgment.\n- The **kings of Judah**, from David down to Jesus Christ, fulfilling God’s covenant promises.\n\nEdom’s kingship shows that Esau truly became a nation with power, but God had already said, “the elder shall serve the younger” (Genesis 25:23). Obadiah 1:10 shows Edom’s end **because of violence against Jacob**. In contrast, the line of David leads to Jesus, “mighty to save” (Isaiah 63:1), who will judge Edom and all proud nations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Bringing it back to your phrase “Saul to Paul”\n\nWithin the Scriptures you supplied:\n\n- **There is no Saul whose name becomes Paul.**\n- We see instead **Saul of Rehoboth by the river**, an **Edomite king**, followed in the list by Baalhanan and then by Hadar, whose **city is Pau/Pai** (Genesis 36:37–39; 1 Chronicles 1:48, 50).\n\nSo in this context, “Saul to Pau” is not a personal transformation, but part of a **succession of mortal, earthly rulers** in the kingdom of Edom—rulers who stand as an example of how human power rises and falls, and how God will ultimately judge the proud nations (Edom, Assyria, Nineveh), while fulfilling His promises through the line of Jacob and David down to Christ.\n\nIf you were aiming to ask about the New Testament Saul who is called Paul, that story and its meaning are found in other KJV passages not included in this data. But from the Scriptures here, the lesson is clear: from Saul of Rehoboth to the city Pau, all **Edomite kings** are temporary; only the King whom God chooses—and the King who is God Himself—endures."

The first Passover: judgment and deliverance (Exodus 12)\n\nIn the anchor passage, the LORD Himself defines what Passover is and how it is to be kept.\n\nThey are to eat a lamb:\n\n> “And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.” (Exodus 12:8)\n\nSpecific instructions are given:\n\n- The lamb must be roasted with fire, not raw or boiled:\n  > “Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast with fire; his head with his legs, and with the purtenance thereof.” (12:9)\n- Nothing must remain until morning; what is left must be burned:\n  > “And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.” (12:10)\n\nThey must eat it ready to leave Egypt:\n\n> “And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the LORD’S passover.” (12:11)\n\nWhy? Because the LORD is about to judge Egypt:\n\n> “For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn… and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.” (12:12)\n\nThe protection from this judgment is the blood of the lamb:\n\n> “And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.” (12:13)\n\nSo:\n\n- The destroyer goes through Egypt to kill the firstborn (Exodus 12:23).\n- The LORD “will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you” when He sees the blood (12:23).\n\nThis is why it is called “the LORD’s passover” (12:11): He passes over those under the blood.\n\nGod then makes that night a perpetual memorial:\n\n> “And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations; ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever.” (Exodus 12:14)\n\n---\n\n## 2. The elements of Passover and what they remember\n\n### Bitter herbs and bitter bondage\n\nThey ate the lamb “with bitter herbs” (Exodus 12:8). Earlier, Scripture says:\n\n> “And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage…” (Exodus 1:14)\n\nDeuteronomy connects the unleavened bread with suffering:\n\n> “…seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste…” (Deuteronomy 16:3)\n\nSo the bitter herbs and “bread of affliction” recall the bitterness of slavery in Egypt and the affliction Israel endured.\n\n### Unleavened bread and haste\n\nIn the first Passover, they had to be ready to move:\n\n> “ye shall eat it in haste” (Exodus 12:11).\n\nDeuteronomy links this haste with unleavened bread:\n\n> “…for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth…” (Deuteronomy 16:3)\n\nThus the feast of unleavened bread is tied to the exodus:\n\n- “Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses” (Exodus 12:15).\n- “Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses” (12:19).\n- “Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread.” (12:20)\n\nThis is expanded:\n\n- “On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat unleavened bread.” (Leviticus 23:6)\n- “Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread… for in it thou camest out from Egypt” (Exodus 23:15).\n- “Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought thee forth out of Egypt by night.” (Deuteronomy 16:1)\n\nSo unleavened bread marks:\n\n- The haste of leaving Egypt.\n- The separation from their old life of bondage.\n\n### The lamb without blemish and entirely consumed\n\nThe Passover lamb is specified:\n\n> “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year…” (Exodus 12:5)\n\nIt is kept until the 14th day and then killed:\n\n> “…the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening.” (Exodus 12:6; cf. Leviticus 23:5)\n\nIt must be roasted with fire, and none left until morning (Exodus 12:9–10). Later, God reaffirms:\n\n- “Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.” (Exodus 34:25)\n- “And there shall… not… any thing of the flesh, which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.” (Deuteronomy 16:4)\n- “And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and go unto thy tents.” (Deuteronomy 16:7)\n\nThis “same day” consumption parallels peace/thanksgiving offerings:\n\n> “the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day… he shall not leave any of it until the morning.” (Leviticus 7:15)\n\nSo the lamb:\n\n- Must be perfect (“without blemish”).\n- Must be fully and promptly consumed.\n- Is both a sacrifice and a meal shared by the redeemed.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Passover as covenant memorial and identity marker\n\nPassover is more than a one-time event; it is bound up with God’s covenant promises.\n\nGod had told Abram:\n\n> “…thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years.” (Genesis 15:13)\n\nHe also promised:\n\n> “I will establish my covenant… to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee… all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.” (Genesis 17:7–8)\n\nIn Exodus, God connects the exodus (and thus Passover) to that promise:\n\n> “And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob…” (Exodus 6:8)\n\nSo Passover is the night when God begins to bring His people out “of the house of bondage” (Exodus 20:2; 13:3) to the land He had sworn.\n\nBecause of this, Passover must be remembered:\n\n- “And this day shall be unto you for a memorial…” (Exodus 12:14).\n- “And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the LORD’S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.” (Exodus 13:9)\n- “And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service? That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD’S passover, who passed over the houses… and delivered our houses.” (Exodus 12:26–27)\n\nThis pattern is confirmed in the Psalms:\n\n- “He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered” (Psalms 111:4).\n- “For he established a testimony in Jacob… that they should make them known to their children” (Psalms 78:5).\n- “That the generation to come might know… who should arise and declare them to their children” (Psalms 78:6).\n\nThus Passover is a yearly, family-taught testimony of:\n\n- Who God is (“that ye may know how that I am the LORD” – Exodus 10:2).\n- What God has done (delivered from bondage by blood and by power).\n- Who God’s people are (a redeemed, separated nation).\n\nOnly those in covenant may eat of it:\n\n> “There shall no stranger eat thereof” (Exodus 12:43).\n\nYet provision is made for the stranger who joins the covenant:\n\n> “when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover… let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land…” (Exodus 12:48)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Leaven and unleavened: from outward sign to spiritual reality\n\nPhysically, Israel was to remove all leaven:\n\n> “Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses” (Exodus 12:19).\n\nGod forbids leaven with the Passover sacrifice:\n\n> “Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven” (Exodus 34:25; cf. 23:18).\n\nIn the prophets and in Christ’s teaching, “leaven” comes to symbolize a spreading, corrupting influence.\n\nJesus warns:\n\n- “Take heed and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.” (Matthew 16:6)\n- The disciples then understand “that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.” (Matthew 16:12)\n- Luke records, “Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.” (Luke 12:1)\n\nSo “leaven” is used of:\n\n- False doctrine (Matthew 16:12).\n- Hypocrisy (Luke 12:1).\n- Outward religion that omits “judgment, mercy, and faith” (Matthew 23:23; cf. 15:9).\n\nPaul uses the same figure:\n\n> “Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?” (1 Corinthians 5:6)\n\nAnd then he applies Passover imagery:\n\n> “Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.” (1 Corinthians 5:7)  \n> “Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.” (5:8)\n\nSo the physical removal of leaven in Israel symbolized and now instructs us in:\n\n- Removing corrupt teaching.\n- Rejecting malice, wickedness, and hypocrisy.\n- Living in “sincerity and truth.”\n\nThis also harmonizes with the call to put off the “old man”:\n\n> “That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts” (Ephesians 4:22),  \n> and to “putting away lying… for we are members one of another.” (Ephesians 4:25)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Passover fulfilled: “Christ our passover”\n\nThe New Testament does not leave us to guess at the deeper meaning of Passover. It plainly identifies the true Passover Lamb:\n\n> “For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us.” (1 Corinthians 5:7)\n\nThe Passover lamb had to be “without blemish” (Exodus 12:5). Peter speaks of our redemption:\n\n> “ye were not redeemed with corruptible things… but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot.” (1 Peter 1:18–19)\n\nIsaiah foretold of the Servant:\n\n> “when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin…” (Isaiah 53:10)\n\nPsalm 22 anticipates his sufferings:\n\n> “I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted…” (Psalms 22:14)\n\nSo Christ is:\n\n- The spotless Lamb (Exodus 12:5; 1 Peter 1:19).\n- Whose soul is made “an offering for sin” (Isaiah 53:10).\n- Whose sufferings match the prophetic description (Psalms 22).\n\nJust as the blood of the Passover lamb made God “pass over” Israel and not destroy them (Exodus 12:13,23), so believers are redeemed and spared judgment by the blood of Christ:\n\n> “Forasmuch as ye know that ye were… redeemed… with the precious blood of Christ…” (1 Peter 1:18–19)\n\n---\n\n## 6. From Passover meal to the Lord’s Supper\n\nThe Gospels are clear that Jesus instituted the Supper at Passover:\n\n- “And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the passover…” (Mark 14:12)\n- “Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.” (Luke 22:7–8)\n- “Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying… Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?” (Matthew 26:17)\n\nIn that setting, He takes bread:\n\n> “And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.” (Matthew 26:26)  \n> “This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22:19)\n\nHe also takes the cup:\n\n> “This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.” (Luke 22:20)\n\nPaul repeats and explains:\n\n> “This is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me. After the same manner also he took the cup… saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.” (1 Corinthians 11:24–25)  \n> “For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord’s death till he come.” (11:26)\n\nSo:\n\n- The old Passover was a memorial of deliverance from Egypt (Exodus 12:14; 13:3,9).\n- The Lord’s Supper is a memorial of Christ’s death and the new covenant in His blood.\n\nAs Israel all ate the lamb and identified as one redeemed people, so believers now:\n\n> “are all partakers of that one bread” and “we being many are one bread, and one body” (1 Corinthians 10:16–17).\n\nPaul also warns that this memorial must be approached worthily:\n\n> “whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself…” (1 Corinthians 11:27–28)\n\nThis matches the Passover requirement that only the circumcised, covenant people could eat (Exodus 12:48).\n\n---\n\n## 7. The “golden thread” of Passover\n\nPutting the passages together, Scripture presents a consistent picture:\n\n1. **Passover in Egypt**  \n   - God judges Egypt and its gods (Exodus 12:12).  \n   - God passes over houses marked by the blood of a spotless lamb (12:7,13,23).  \n   - Israel leaves the “house of bondage” (Exodus 13:3; 20:2) in haste, eating unleavened bread, the “bread of affliction” (Deuteronomy 16:3) with bitter herbs (Exodus 12:8).\n\n2. **Passover as Israel’s perpetual memorial**  \n   - Kept every year on the 14th day of the first month (Leviticus 23:5; Exodus 13:4–6).  \n   - Closely joined with the seven days of unleavened bread; no leaven at all (Exodus 12:15–20; 13:6–7).  \n   - Held in the place where the LORD chooses to put His name (Deuteronomy 12:5–6; 16:2,5–7).  \n   - Taught diligently to children as a testimony of the LORD’s mighty works (Exodus 12:26–27; 13:8–9; Psalms 78:4–6; 111:4).\n\n3. **Passover’s spiritual meaning: holiness and truth**  \n   - Physical leaven removed from houses points to spiritual leaven of false doctrine, hypocrisy, and sin (Matthew 16:6,12; Luke 12:1).  \n   - Believers are to “purge out… the old leaven” and “keep the feast… with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:7–8).\n\n4. **Christ, the true Passover Lamb**  \n   - He is the Lamb “without blemish” (Exodus 12:5; 1 Peter 1:19).  \n   - His soul is made “an offering for sin” (Isaiah 53:10).  \n   - His sufferings match Psalm 22 (Psalms 22:14).  \n   - “Christ our passover is sacrificed for us” (1 Corinthians 5:7).  \n   - By His blood we are redeemed (1 Peter 1:18–19), as Israel was spared by the lamb’s blood.\n\n5. **The new memorial: the Lord’s Supper**  \n   - Instituted at Passover (Matthew 26; Mark 14; Luke 22).  \n   - The bread represents His body given; the cup His blood of the new testament (Luke 22:19–20; 1 Corinthians 11:24–25).  \n   - It is a continual remembrance of His death until He comes (1 Corinthians 11:26), just as Passover was a continual remembrance of the exodus (Exodus 12:14; 13:9).\n\nIn sum, according to the KJV Scriptures given:\n\n- Passover is the LORD’s own appointed way of marking out His people by blood, bringing them out of bondage, and calling them to a life separated from corruption (leaven) and full of remembrance.\n- In the New Testament, that pattern is fulfilled and deepened in Jesus Christ, “our passover,” whose blood secures our redemption and whose death we remember in the Supper, keeping the feast now “with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth” (1 Corinthians 5:8)."
