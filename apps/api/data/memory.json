        "content": "In this passage the LORD himself defines what true faith in Israel is meant to look like, by setting Moses apart.\n\nThe scene begins with the LORD calling Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to the tabernacle of the congregation (Numbers 12:4). They obey his voice and “came out,” showing outward submission. Then “the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle” (12:5), a visible sign of his presence in the midst of Israel. Faith for Israel is never abstract; it is response to the God who truly dwells among them.\n\nGod then explains how he normally speaks: “If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak unto him in a dream” (12:6). Faith in Israel is therefore tied to hearing and believing the word God reveals.\n\nBut Moses is unique: “My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house” (12:7). The LORD trusts Moses with “all” his house—his people, his worship, his commandments. With Moses he speaks “mouth to mouth… and not in dark speeches” (12:8). Israel’s faith is to receive God’s clear word through this faithful servant.\n\nWhen Aaron and Miriam are not “afraid to speak against my servant Moses” (12:8), the LORD’s anger is kindled (12:9), and Miriam becomes leprous (12:10). Doubting or challenging God’s appointed spokesman is treated as doubting God himself.\n\nSo in this short scene, Israel’s true faith is shown as:\n- Fearing the LORD’s presence,\n- Hearing the LORD’s word,\n- Submitting to the faithful servant through whom he speaks.\n\nWhat aspect of “Israel’s faith” would you like to explore next—Moses’ faithfulness, Israel’s unbelief in the wilderness, or how this pattern of a faithful servant continues through Scripture?"

        "content": "The phrase “water into wine” rests on the more basic truth Scripture first reveals in creation.\n\n“In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth” [Genesis 1:1]. When the earth was “without form, and void,” and “darkness was upon the face of the deep,” already “the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters” [Genesis 1:2]. Then “God said, Let there be light: and there was light” [Genesis 1:3]. Matter, light, and the primordial waters exist and change at His word alone.\n\nThis pattern continues: “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made” [Psalms 33:6]; “For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast” [Psalms 33:9]. “He commanded, and they were created” [Psalms 148:5]. He made “the seas, and all that is therein” and “preservest them all” [Nehemiah 9:6]; “The sea is his, and he made it” [Psalms 95:5]. Thus we are called to “worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters” [Revelation 14:7].\n\nGod not only begins creation; He actively works within it: “in wisdom hast thou made them all” [Psalms 104:24]; “Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth” [Psalms 104:30]. All things are “the work of thy hands” [Psalms 102:25] and exist “for thy pleasure” [Revelation 4:11].\n\nBy contrast, “an idol is nothing in the world” [1 Corinthians 8:4]; it is only “the work of men’s hands” [Psalms 115:4], unable to see, hear, or act [Psalms 115:5-7].\n\nSo any true change of substance—such as water becoming something else—is simply another exercise of the same divine power first displayed when God spoke light out of darkness and ordered the waters in [Genesis 1:1-5].\n\nTo focus this more for you: are you mainly wondering (1) how such a miracle is possible, (2) what its spiritual meaning is, or (3) what it teaches about wine and drinking?"

        "content": "Matthew anchors John the Baptist in history: after Joseph brings the young child Jesus back to Israel and settles in Nazareth [Matthew 2:20-23], we read, “In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea” [Matthew 3:1]. His message is simple and sharp: “Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” [Matthew 3:2].  \n\nMatthew identifies John as the fulfilment of Isaiah: “The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight” [Matthew 3:3; Isaiah 40:3]. Luke adds that John would “go before him in the spirit and power of Elias… to make ready a people prepared for the Lord” [Luke 1:17], and calls him “the prophet of the Highest” who will “prepare his ways” [Luke 1:76]. This matches the Old Testament theme of God making a “highway” and “way of holiness” for His people [Isaiah 35:8; Isaiah 57:14; Isaiah 62:10].  \n\nJohn prepares that way by preaching “the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins” [Mark 1:4; Luke 3:3]. People are baptized, “confessing their sins” [Matthew 3:5-6], in harmony with God’s call to confess iniquity [Leviticus 26:40; Psalms 32:5] and to “wash you, make you clean… cease to do evil; Learn to do well” [Isaiah 1:16-17]. He demands real change: “Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance” [Matthew 3:8; Luke 3:8], which he applies practically [Luke 3:10-14].  \n\nYet John is not the focus; Christ is. “He that cometh after me is mightier than I… he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire” [Matthew 3:11; Mark 1:7-8; Luke 3:16]. He portrays Messiah as judge, gathering wheat and burning chaff “with unquenchable fire” [Matthew 3:12; Luke 3:17]. When Jesus comes to John, He says, “thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness” [Matthew 3:15], and heaven testifies of Him [Matthew 3:16].  \n\nJesus Himself says, “Among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist” [Matthew 11:11; Luke 7:28], yet John’s greatness is in pointing away from himself to the Lamb of God and the nearness of God’s kingdom [Mark 1:15].  \n\nWhich aspect of John the Baptist would you like to dig into more: his message of repentance, his relationship to Jesus (especially Jesus’ baptism), or the difference between John’s water baptism and Christ’s baptism with the Holy Ghost and with fire?"

        "content": "“Water into wine” points us to the God who *alone* can command creation.\n\n### 1. The Anchor: God’s creative word over the waters\n\nIn the beginning, “the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters” [Genesis 1:2]. Then, “God said, Let there be light: and there was light” [Genesis 1:3].  \n\nHere we see:\n- God’s *word* creates.\n- God’s *Spirit* moves upon the waters.\n- God separates and orders what was formless [Genesis 1:4–5].\n\nThis same pattern—God speaking, and creation obeying—is echoed: “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made” [Psalms 33:6]; “For he spake, and it was done” [Psalms 33:9]. He made heaven, earth, sea, and “all that in them is” [Exodus 20:11], and saw it was “very good” [Genesis 1:31].\n\n### 2. Only the true Creator can change creation\n\nScripture insists the LORD alone “made heaven, the heaven of heavens… the seas, and all that is therein” [Nehemiah 9:6]; “Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created” [Psalms 104:30].  \n\nIn contrast, idols are “silver and gold, the work of men’s hands” [Psalms 115:4]. They have mouths, eyes, ears, hands, and feet, but “they speak not… see not… hear not… walk not” [Psalms 115:5–7]. An idol “is nothing in the world” [1 Corinthians 8:4]. They cannot change water—or anything else.\n\nThus when God alters creation, it is a display of the same power seen when He first said, “Let there be light.” All such wonders flow from the Creator “which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters” [RE 14:7], who “created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created” [RE 4:11].\n\nSo any true “water into wine” miracle is a sign of that original Genesis power: God’s word and Spirit transforming what He made.\n\nWould you like to explore next how God’s creative power connects to Christ’s identity, or how He spiritually transforms a person’s life?"

He alone “hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens… the seas, and all that is therein” [Nehemiah 9:6]. So heaven and earth, sea and “fountains of waters” are all under His command [Revelation 14:7; Revelation 4:11].\n\nIn contrast, idols “are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands” [Psalms 115:4]. They have mouths, eyes, ears, hands, and feet, but “they speak not… see not… handle not… walk not” [Psalms 115:5-7]. “They that make them are like unto them” [Psalms 115:8]. Isaiah mocks those who from one tree both warm themselves and then make a god, “an abomination” [Isaiah 44:15,19]. Thus “an idol is nothing in the world, and… there is none other God but one” [1 Corinthians 8:4; Isaiah 41:29]. Idols cannot change a drop of water.\n\nWhen Jesus turned water into wine at Cana [John 2:1-11], He did what only the Creator of [Genesis 1:1-3] can do. He simply said, “Fill the waterpots with water,” and the water, without process or time, became “wine” of the best kind [John 2:7-10]. This miracle “manifested forth his glory” [John 2:11], the same glory declared by the heavens [Psalms 19:1]. Scripture says of Christ, “All things were made by him” [John 1:3]; the creative word that once said “Let there be light” now, in flesh, commands water itself. The god of this world blinds minds “lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them” [2 Corinthians 4:4], but in this sign the true Light is revealed.\n\nWould you like to look next at what this miracle teaches about Jesus’ deity, about wine and joy in Scripture, or about how He changes our lives as He changed that water?"

        "content": "In [Genesis 1:1-5] we see God’s first great “change”:  \n\n- He creates heaven and earth out of nothing [Genesis 1:1].  \n- His Spirit moves “upon the face of the waters” [Genesis 1:2].  \n- He speaks, “Let there be light: and there was light” [Genesis 1:3].  \n\nCreation happens simply because God speaks. This same pattern is echoed: “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made” [Psalms 33:6]; “For he spake, and it was done” [Psalms 33:9]. He made “the sea, and all that in them is” [Exodus 20:11], and “the sea is his, and he made it” [Psalms 95:5]. So all water belongs to Him.  \n\nScripture contrasts this living Creator with dead idols. The nations’ gods are “idols: but the LORD made the heavens” [Psalms 96:5]. Their images are “the work of men’s hands” [Psalms 115:4], unable to see, hear, or act [Psalms 115:5-7]. But the true God “stretcheth forth the heavens alone… spreadeth abroad the earth by myself” [Isaiah 44:24]. Paul concludes, “an idol is nothing in the world, and… there is none other God but one” [1 Corinthians 8:4].  \n\nWhen Jesus later turns water into wine at Cana ([John 2:1-11]), that act is of the same kind as Genesis 1: a word of sovereign power over creation. The One who first commanded light out of darkness [Genesis 1:3] is now present as “the image of God” [2 Corinthians 4:4], and the elements obey Him. This miracle is a sign that the Creator has come in the flesh, calling us to “worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters” [Revelation 14:7].  \n\nWhen you mention “water to wine,” are you most interested in: (1) the meaning of Jesus’ first miracle, (2) what the Bible says about wine and drinking, or (3) how this shows Jesus as the Creator? I can build a focused study on whichever you’d like."

        "content": "The miracle of “water into wine” is recorded in [John 2:1‑11]. There we read that Jesus commanded the servants to fill six waterpots with water, and when the ruler of the feast tasted it, “the water that was made wine” [John 2:9], John concludes: “This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him” [John 2:11].\n\nTo see what kind of glory this is, Scripture first shows us God’s power in creation. In [Genesis 1:1‑5], God creates heaven and earth, the Spirit of God moves upon “the face of the waters” [Genesis 1:2], and God simply speaks: “Let there be light: and there was light” [Genesis 1:3]. The Psalms explain this: “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made” [Psalms 33:6], and, “he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast” [Psalms 33:9]. Only the LORD “made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is” [Exodus 20:11; Nehemiah 9:6; Isaiah 45:18].\n\nBy contrast, idols are “the work of men’s hands” [Psalms 115:4], that “see not… hear not… walk not” [Psalms 115:5‑7]; “an idol is nothing in the world” [1 Corinthians 8:4]. They cannot create or change anything.\n\nThe New Testament then says of Christ, “All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made” [John 1:3]. So when Jesus, by his will alone, instantly turns plain water into good wine, it is an act like Genesis—creative power by the word of God. It shows that the Jesus of Cana is the Creator of [Genesis 1], the One “who made heaven, and earth, and the sea” [Revelation 14:7], and it leads his disciples to believe on him [John 2:11].\n\nIs there a particular aspect you’d like to explore more—the details of the miracle itself, the symbolism of the wine, or how this reveals Jesus as Creator?"

Then “God said, Let there be light: and there was light” [Genesis 1:3]. God sees the light is good and divides it from the darkness [Genesis 1:4], [Genesis 1:5]. He also names the dry land Earth and “the gathering together of the waters” Seas [Genesis 1:10]. From the beginning, water, light, and all matter exist and change at God’s command.\n\nScripture repeats this: “Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven… the earth, and all things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein” [Nehemiah 9:6]. “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made” [Psalms 33:6], and “he spake, and it was done” [Psalms 33:9]. “The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land” [Psalms 95:5]; he “stretched out the earth above the waters” [Psalms 136:6]. So we must “worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters” [Revelation 14:7]. Creation “declare[s] the glory of God” [Psalms 19:1]. Idols are only “the work of men’s hands” [Psalms 115:4], unable to speak, see, hear, or act [Psalms 115:5], [Psalms 115:6], [Psalms 115:7]; those who trust them become like them [Psalms 115:8]. They are vanity and bring shame [Isaiah 44:9], [Isaiah 44:10], [Isaiah 44:11]. Thus “an idol is nothing in the world” [1 Corinthians 8:4].\n\nThe New Testament records that Jesus turned water into wine at a marriage feast in Cana. Such an instant transformation of created elements belongs to the God who made all things “and for [whose] pleasure they are and were created” [Revelation 4:11]. It fits the pattern, “he spake, and it was done” [Psalms 33:9], and shows that the same God who said “Let there be light” [Genesis 1:3] now shines “the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God” [2 Corinthians 4:4].\n\nWhich aspect of this sign would you like to dig into more: how it reveals Christ’s deity, how it pictures new creation and joy, or how it calls us to faith and obedience?"

Jesus goes straight to the heart: “Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” [John 3:3]. This new birth is explained as being “born of water and of the Spirit” [John 3:5], contrasting flesh and Spirit: “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit” [John 3:6]. John has already said that those who receive Christ are those “which were born…of God” [John 1:12-13].\n\nJesus then shows how this new life comes: through faith in His death and exaltation. “As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up” [John 3:14], so that “whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life” [John 3:15].\n\nThis is unfolded in the famous words: “For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son…” [John 3:16]. The same passage makes clear that unbelief brings condemnation [John 3:18] and that men naturally “loved darkness rather than light” [John 3:19].\n\nThe chapter closes with John the Baptist exalting Christ: “He must increase, but I must decrease” [John 3:30], and a final dividing line: “He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life…he that believeth not the Son shall not see life” [John 3:36].\n\nWhich part of John 3 would you like to explore more deeply—the new birth, God’s love in [John 3:16], or the warning in [John 3:18-21] and [John 3:36]?"

Verse 16 expands that thought.\n\n**“For God so loved the world”**  \nThe initiative is God’s. His love reaches not a few, but “the world,” including sinners. This is echoed: “But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” [Romans 5:8]. Likewise, “Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son” [1 John 4:10].\n\n**“that he gave his only begotten Son”**  \nThe Son is “the only begotten of the Father” [John 1:14], “the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father” [John 1:18]—unique, dearly beloved. God “gave” Him, ultimately at the cross. This gift theme appears again: “He… spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all” [Romans 8:32].\n\n**“that whosoever believeth in him”**  \nThe offer is universal—“whosoever.” Believing is trusting in and receiving Christ: “as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name” [John 1:12]. “Whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” [Romans 10:13].\n\n**“should not perish, but have everlasting life”**  \nWithout Christ, men are “condemned already” [John 3:18], and “the wages of sin is death” [Romans 6:23]. But “the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord” [Romans 6:23]. This life is *in* the Son: “God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son” [1 John 5:11].\n\nSo [John 3:16] gathers the gospel in one verse: God’s love, God’s gift, man’s believing response, and God’s promise of everlasting life.\n\nWhich part of this verse would you like to explore more deeply—God’s love, the meaning of “only begotten Son,” what it means to “believe,” or “everlasting life”?"

His city name, *Rehoboth*, links back to the early nations:\n\n> “Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city **Rehoboth**…” [Genesis 10:11]\n\nFrom there, the genealogy of references moves to great empires God later uses as His instruments—Assyria and others ([1 Chronicles 5:26], [Isaiah 10:5–6], [2 Chronicles 33:11]). Then we see the Lord just as sovereign in *restoring* His people:\n\n> “The LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia” [Ezra 1:1],  \n> “Then rose up the chief of the fathers…whose spirit God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD” [Ezra 1:5; cf. [2 Chronicles 36:21–22], [Ezra 7:27]].\n\nSo from an obscure Saul in Edom to mighty kings like Cyrus, Scripture shows: **God rules over all rulers and turns their hearts as He pleases.**\n\nThe same God also changes *persons*, not just thrones. Jacob wrestles with God and receives a new name:\n\n> “Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but **Israel**…” [Genesis 32:24,28; cf. 32:30]  \nRachel calls her son **Benoni** (“son of my sorrow”), but his father calls him **Benjamin** (“son of the right hand”) [Genesis 35:18].\n\nThis pattern—God giving a new identity and purpose—prepares us to understand Saul of Tarsus, later “also called Paul” [Acts 13:9], whose heart and mission were utterly turned by the risen Christ [Acts 9:1–6,15].\n\nWould you like to focus next on Saul/Paul’s conversion in Acts, or on the broader theme of God changing names and destinies (like Jacob/Israel, Benoni/Benjamin)?"

        "content": "[John 3:16] stands in the middle of Jesus’ night conversation with Nicodemus about the new birth and entrance into the kingdom of God [John 3:1-3]. Just before it, Jesus says He must be “lifted up” like the serpent in the wilderness, “That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life” [John 3:14-15]. Verse 16 then explains *why* this lifting up (His death) will happen.\n\n**“For God so loved the world”**  \nThe source of salvation is God’s love. This love is toward “the world,” not a narrow group. Elsewhere, Scripture shows that this love is toward sinners: “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” [Romans 5:8]. John writes, “In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world” [1 John 4:9].\n\n**“that he gave his only begotten Son”**  \nGod’s love is shown by *giving* His Son—sending Him into the world and to the cross. John immediately adds, “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved” [John 3:17].\n\n**“that whosoever believeth in him”**  \nThe promise is open to “whosoever.” Believing in Him is trusting His person and work. “He that believeth on him is not condemned” [John 3:18]; “as many as received him… to them gave he power to become the sons of God” [John 1:12].\n\n**“should not perish, but have everlasting life”**  \nWithout Christ, we face death as the wages of sin [Romans 6:23]. In Him, the believer *has* (present possession) everlasting life: “He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life” [John 5:24].\n\nIs there a part of [John 3:16] you’d like to look at more closely—God’s love, “believeth,” or “everlasting life”?"

When he sees these crowds, he withdraws upward, not to escape them, but to teach from a place set apart. A similar pattern appears later: “great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there” [Matthew 19:2], and again, “great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all” [Matthew 12:15].\n\nOn the mountain he “was set” – the posture of a teacher – and “his disciples came unto him” [Matthew 5:1]. These are the men later named “the twelve apostles” in [Matthew 10:2‑4] and [Luke 6:14‑15], whom he had called from fishing and tax‑collecting, saying, “Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men” [Matthew 4:19; Matthew 4:20; Luke 5:10; Mark 2:14]. God would later “give some, apostles… and some, pastors and teachers” [Ephesians 4:11]; here they sit at the feet of the Master Teacher.\n\nThe multitudes are still in view. At the end, “the people were astonished at his doctrine” [Matthew 7:28], just as in other places where “many hearing him were astonished, saying, What wisdom is this” [Mark 6:2], and “they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power” [Luke 4:32].\n\nLinked with [Matthew 13:2], where he again sits to teach a great multitude, and with the parable of the sower [Matthew 13:3‑6; Luke 8:4‑6,11‑12], we see the Sermon on the Mount as the Lord sowing “the word of the kingdom” [Matthew 13:19] into hearts—especially his disciples’, who must later teach others.\n\nWhich part of the Sermon on the Mount would you like to explore more deeply—the Beatitudes, Jesus and the law, prayer (the Lord’s Prayer), love of enemies, or something else?"

        "content": "[Genesis 19:11] shows blindness as **judgment**:  \n“And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness… so that they wearied themselves to find the door.”\n\nThese men are so struck that, though the door is near, they can’t find it. This picture of groping in vain is later used by God to describe His curse on a disobedient people:  \n“The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart: And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways” [Deuteronomy 28:28‑29].  \n\nTheir **weariness** matches Sodom’s men who “wearied themselves to find the door” [Genesis 19:11]. The fool’s life is like this: “The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city” [Ecclesiastes 10:15].\n\nThe prophets show this blindness is ultimately **spiritual**. God tells Isaiah:  \n“Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not… shut their eyes; lest they see… and convert, and be healed” [Isaiah 6:9‑10].  \nDavid prays of the wicked, “Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not” [Psalms 69:23].\n\nJesus applies Isaiah’s word to His own generation:  \n“In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias… this people's heart is waxed gross… and their eyes they have closed; lest at any time they should see… and should be converted, and I should heal them” [Matthew 13:14‑15; cf. Luke 8:10; Mark 4:12].\n\nSo when Jesus **opens blind eyes** in the Gospels (for example, the man born blind in [John 9:1‑7], or Bartimaeus in [Mark 10:46‑52]), these miracles are signs that He also heals the deeper blindness of the heart. Paul says, “their minds were blinded… which vail is done away in Christ” [2 Corinthians 3:14], and the gospel is hid only “to them that are lost” [2 Corinthians 4:3].\n\nIn the end, Christ says, “Behold, I make all things new” [Revelation 21:5], and the tree of life’s leaves are “for the healing of the nations” [Revelation 22:2]—full and final healing of every curse, including blindness.\n\nWhich aspect would you like to explore next:  \n- one specific story where Jesus heals a blind person, verse by verse, or  \n- the theme of spiritual blindness and how Christ opens the heart to believe?"

        "content": "[Genesis 19:11] shows the LORD’s angels judging the men of Sodom: “they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness… so that they wearied themselves to find the door.” This is not healing, but a curse: they are struck blind in their sin, still grasping for evil, yet unable even to find a door.\n\nMoses describes the same kind of judgment on hardened Israel: “The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and astonishment of heart: And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness” [Deuteronomy 28:28‑29]. Ecclesiastes says, “The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city” [Ecclesiastes 10:15]. Isaiah adds, “Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way” [Isaiah 57:10]. Blindness and weariness picture a life of rebellion under God’s curse.\n\nThe prophets deepen this: God sends Isaiah to a people who “see ye indeed, but perceive not” [Isaiah 6:9]; their eyes are shut “lest… they… understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed” [Isaiah 6:10]. David prays of the wicked, “Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not” [Psalms 69:23‑24]. God “hath closed your eyes” [Isaiah 29:10]; “he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see” [Isaiah 44:18]. This is spiritual blindness.\n\nYet Nehemiah recounts that though Israel rebelled, God “many times didst… deliver them according to thy mercies” [Nehemiah 9:28,31; cf. Psalms 106:43‑45]. He is “not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance” [2 Peter 3:9]. He opens waters in the desert [Isaiah 41:17‑18; Isaiah 48:21], and we learn “that Rock was Christ” [1 Corinthians 10:4]. In Christ the veil is “done away” [2 Corinthians 3:14], and in the end the tree of life’s leaves are “for the healing of the nations” [Revelation 22:2].\n\nSo when Jesus heals the blind in the Gospels, those miracles picture this deeper work: turning cursed, God‑given blindness into sight, replacing folly with true wisdom “in the fear of the LORD” [Psalms 111:10], calling us to repent [Luke 13:3] and turn from idols “that cannot save” [Isaiah 45:20] to Christ, the wisdom and power of God [1 Corinthians 1:24].\n\nWould you like to look next at Jesus’ specific healings of the blind in the Gospels, or stay with this theme of spiritual blindness and sight in salvation?"

        "content": "### 1. Anchor: Blindness as God’s Judgment\n\nIn [Genesis 19:11] the angels at Lot’s house “smote the men … with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.” This is God’s immediate judgment on Sodom’s violent wickedness, but the wording points beyond that night. They are not only unable to see; they exhaust themselves in vain, groping for the very way of escape that is right before them.  \n\nThis futility matches the fool whose “labour … wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city” [Ecclesiastes 10:15], and Israel “wearied in the greatness of thy way” yet refusing to admit there is no hope in idols [Isaiah 57:10].\n\n### 2. From Physical to Spiritual Blindness\n\nUnder the law this same blindness becomes a covenant curse: “The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness,… And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in darkness” [Deuteronomy 28:28-29]. David prays, “Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not… Pour out thine indignation upon them” [Psalms 69:23-24].  \n\nIsaiah explains it as God’s judicial hardening: “Make the heart of this people fat… shut their eyes; lest they see… and convert, and be healed” [Isaiah 6:10]. Later he adds, “the LORD hath… closed your eyes” [Isaiah 29:10]. Blindness becomes a picture of a heart that refuses God until God confirms it in darkness.\n\n### 3. Christ: From Blindness to Healing\n\nJesus applies these words to his own generation: in them “is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias,” so that “seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive” [Matthew 13:14]. Their “eyes they have closed,” lest they should “be converted, and I should heal them” [Matthew 13:15; Luke 8:10].  \n\nYet this same Lord does heal. In the Gospels he opens the eyes of the physically blind, and through his cross and resurrection the veil of spiritual blindness “is done away in Christ” [2 Corinthians 3:14]. So the God who smote Sodom with blindness [Genesis 19:11] now, in Christ, brings true “healing” even to the nations [Revelation 22:2].\n\n---\n\nWould you like next to look more closely at one of Jesus’ healings of a blind person, or at how Scripture describes spiritual blindness and sight in our own lives today?"

        "content": "In [Genesis 1:2] the earth is “without form, and void,” covered in water and darkness, yet we read, “the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” From the very beginning, God is shown as Lord over the deep, bringing order where there is chaos.\n\nThis Creator-power is expanded elsewhere: “By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth” [Psalms 33:6]. “Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth” [Psalms 104:30]. The same God who first moved upon the waters also rules them continually: “For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods” [Psalms 24:2]; “To him that stretched out the earth above the waters” [Psalms 136:6].\n\nMost strikingly, Job says of God, “Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea” [Job 9:8]. The floods may “lift up their waves,” yet “The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters” [Psalms 93:3-4]. His voice is “upon the waters” [Psalms 29:3].\n\nWhen Jesus comes to His disciples “walking on the sea” [Matthew 14:25], and Peter walks to Him “on the water” [Matthew 14:29], this is not a random wonder. It is the Creator of [Genesis 1:2] and [Job 9:8] revealed in flesh, doing what Scripture says only God does—treading upon the waves, stilling the wind, and drawing sinking sinners by His hand [Matthew 14:30-33].\n\nWhich angle of “Jesus walks on water” are you most wanting to understand—His deity as Creator, Peter’s faith and fear, or how this speaks to the storms in your own life?"

Just before, He names the feasts: “the feast of weeks… and the feast of ingathering at the year's end” [Exodus 34:22], and He adds, “none shall appear before me empty” [Exodus 34:20]. Earlier He had said, “Three times thou shalt keep a feast unto me in the year” [Exodus 23:14], and, “Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD” [Exodus 23:17]. This is repeated in detail in [Deuteronomy 16:16], tying it to the feast of unleavened bread, weeks, and tabernacles.  \n\nSo “thrice” here marks **repeated, covenant faithfulness**—Israel’s men appearing before the LORD with offerings and joy, remembering deliverance from Egypt [Exodus 13:3; Deuteronomy 16:12], and rejoicing before Him [Deuteronomy 16:11,14–15]. Thus, they “appear before God” [Psalms 84:7; Psalms 42:2] in worship, not in shame.  \n\nJesus Himself, as an Israelite male, walked in this pattern: “when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast” [Luke 2:42]. He kept perfectly what the law required.  \n\nPeter, however, on the Passover night when Christ fulfilled the true meaning of the feast [Leviticus 23:5; Exodus 13:6–7], **failed** to stand before the Lord. Jesus foretold, “the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me” [Luke 22:34], and it came to pass [Luke 22:54–62]. Where Israel’s males were to appear before the LORD three times in faith, Peter denied the Lord three times in fear.  \n\nYet the Lord restored him by drawing from him a threefold confession of love [John 21:15–17], bringing him back into true, covenant faithfulness.  \n\nWould you like to look next at Peter’s three denials in the Gospel text itself, or at his threefold restoration and later boldness in Acts?"
