Project Vision Document for Handcrafted Scented Lotions
Problem Statement
Consumers are increasingly seeking natural and soothing products that enhance their well-being. However, many existing lotion options are filled with synthetic ingredients and lack the personal touch that handcrafted products offer. This creates a gap in the market for high-quality, handcrafted scented lotions that provide both therapeutic benefits and an enjoyable sensory experience.
