Project Vision Document for Online Cookie Delivery Service
1. Problem Statement
Busy families often struggle to find the time to bake fresh, homemade cookies, which can lead to missed opportunities for family bonding and enjoyment of treats. The hassle of baking—gathering ingredients, preparation, and cleanup—can be overwhelming, especially for parents juggling multiple responsibilities. Our service aims to eliminate this barrier by providing fresh, homemade cookies delivered directly to their doorstep, allowing families to enjoy delicious treats without the hassle of baking.
