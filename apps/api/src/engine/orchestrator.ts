      P1: `A professional environment is the foundation of success. Here's how to set up like a pro:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**Essential Setup Strategy:**

1. **Tools & Infrastructure**: Identify the core tools professionals in this domain use daily. Don't over-engineer - start with the 3-5 most critical ones.

2. **Workspace Architecture**: Design your space (physical or digital) for deep work. Remove distractions, organize resources within arm's reach, establish clear boundaries.

3. **Professional Credibility**: Secure any licenses, permits, accounts, or credentials needed to operate legitimately in this space.

4. **Proof-of-Concept Milestone**: Create the smallest possible demonstration that your setup works - a "hello world" moment that proves you're ready to build.

**Pro Tip**: The goal isn't perfection, it's professional capability. You should feel confident saying "I'm ready to start" after this phase.

**Domain-Specific Considerations**: Different project types need different setups. A tech project needs development environment, a business needs legal structure, a creative project needs production tools.`,

      P2: `Every successful project starts with the simplest version that proves the core concept. Here's the input‚Üíprocess‚Üíoutput framework:

**Project Vision:** ${userVision}

**Core Loop Essentials:**

1. **Define Your Input**: What's the simplest form of raw material your project consumes? (customer request, data, raw material, etc.)

2. **Design Your Process**: What's the ONE core transformation that creates value? Strip away everything else.

3. **Deliver Your Output**: What's the minimal viable result that proves your concept works?

**The 24-Hour Rule**: Your core loop must be completable in one focused work session. If it takes longer, it's not minimal enough.

**Real-World Examples:**
- App: Single button ‚Üí simple function ‚Üí visible result
- Business: One customer ‚Üí core service ‚Üí payment received
- Content: One piece ‚Üí distribution ‚Üí audience feedback

**Success Metric**: Someone else should be able to understand your project's value proposition within 30 seconds of seeing your core loop in action.`,

      P3: `Strategic expansion beats feature creep every time. Here's how to grow systematically:

**Current Foundation:** ${userVision}

**The Single-Addition Principle:**

1. **Assess What's Working**: Document exactly what your current version does well. Don't break what's already valuable.

2. **Identify the One Big Gap**: What's the single most obvious limitation preventing wider adoption or deeper value?

3. **Layer, Don't Replace**: Add new functionality as a layer on top of existing systems, not a replacement for them.

4. **Test Continuously**: Each addition should be validated independently before moving to the next layer.

**Expansion Priority Framework:**
- **Must-Have**: Solves a real user pain point
- **Should-Have**: Enhances existing value significantly
- **Could-Have**: Nice to have, but doesn't move the needle

**The Golden Rule**: If you can't explain why this specific addition matters in one sentence, it's not ready to build.

**Next Layer Planning**: Always end this phase with a clear sense of what layer 3 should tackle.`,

      P4: `Real user feedback is the only validation that matters. Here's how to gather it without wasting time:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The 3-5 Person Rule**: More feedback isn't better feedback. Find 3-5 people who represent your target audience and go deep.

**Testing Structure:**

1. **What to Show**: Present your actual working project, not a mockup. Let them interact with the real thing.

2. **Questions That Matter**:
   - "What problem does this solve for you?"
   - "What would make this significantly more valuable?"
   - "Would you actually use/buy/recommend this?"

3. **Metrics to Track**:
   - Time to understand the value proposition
   - Willingness to take next action (sign up, pay, refer)
   - Specific improvement suggestions

**The Pivot vs. Proceed Decision Matrix:**
- **Proceed**: Clear value understanding + positive engagement + actionable feedback
- **Pivot**: Confusion about purpose + low engagement + fundamental objections

**Pro Insight**: If users can't explain your project's value in their own words, you haven't built the right thing yet.`,

      P5: `Launch-ready means good enough to put your reputation behind. Here's the quality threshold:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The Essential Fixes Framework:**

1. **Critical Path Issues**: Anything that breaks the core user journey must be fixed. No exceptions.

2. **Professional Polish**: Your project should feel intentional, not amateur. Focus on the details users actually notice.

3. **Scope Lock**: No new features. This phase is about fixing, not building.

**Priority Order:**
- **P0**: Core functionality broken or unreliable
- **P1**: User experience feels unprofessional or confusing
- **P2**: Edge cases that affect real usage
- **P3**: Nice-to-haves that don't impact launch success

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Core user journey works 100% of the time
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] User interface feels intentional and clean
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for intended use
- [ ] Content is proofread and accurate

**The Launch Litmus Test**: Would you confidently demo this to someone whose opinion you respect?`,

      P6: `A focused launch beats a scattered announcement every time. Here's the proven formula:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The Single CTA Strategy:**

1. **One Clear Action**: What's the ONE thing you want people to do? Sign up, buy, download, follow? Pick one.

2. **Launch Platform Selection**: Where does your audience actually spend time? Start there, expand later.

3. **Message Clarity**: Your launch message should answer "What is this?" and "Why should I care?" in under 10 seconds.

**Launch Sequence:**
- **Pre-Launch**: Build anticipation with 2-3 people who care about your success
- **Launch Day**: Share in 2-3 places maximum, with consistent messaging
- **Post-Launch**: Follow up with initial users for testimonials and improvements

**Critical Metrics (First 72 Hours):**
1. **Awareness**: How many people saw your launch?
2. **Engagement**: How many took your desired action?
3. **Quality**: How positive was the initial feedback?

**Launch Success Formula**: Consistent message + Right audience + Clear next step = Sustainable momentum

**Pro Tip**: A small launch that gets real users beats a big launch that gets only views.`,

      P7: `The best builders learn systematically from every project. Here's how to capture what matters:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The Three-Lens Analysis:**

1. **What Worked**: Document the decisions, processes, and strategies that delivered results. These become your repeatable playbook.

2. **What Didn't**: Identify the bottlenecks, mistakes, and dead ends. Understanding failure prevents repetition.

3. **What You'd Do Differently**: With perfect hindsight, what would you change about your approach?

**Personal Toolkit Development:**
- **Process Wins**: Which workflows made you most productive?
- **Tool Discoveries**: What software, resources, or methods proved invaluable?
- **Mental Models**: What frameworks helped you make better decisions?

**Next Project Planning:**
- **Skill Gaps**: What abilities would make your next project easier?
- **Resource Needs**: What tools or knowledge should you acquire first?
- **Project Selection**: Based on this experience, what type of project should you tackle next?

**Documentation Format**: Keep it simple - bullet points, not essays. Focus on actionable insights you'll actually reference later.

**The Growth Mindset**: Every project is training for the next one. The goal isn't perfection, it's systematic improvement.`,
