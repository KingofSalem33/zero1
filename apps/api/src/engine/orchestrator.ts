UNIVERSAL STRUCTURE (Keep these phase IDs):
- P1: Build Environment
- P2: Core Loop
- P3: Layered Expansion
- P4: Reality Test
- P5: Polish & Freeze Scope
- P6: Launch
- P7: Reflect & Evolve

YOUR JOB: Customize each phase for THIS specific project type and domain.

EXAMPLES:

For "cookie business":
- P1 goal: "Set up commercial kitchen and food business infrastructure"
- P1 why_it_matters: "Commercial kitchen permits, equipment, and food safety certifications are legally required before selling"
- P1 acceptance_criteria: ["Commercial kitchen licensed or home kitchen permitted", "Equipment installed and tested", "First test batch successfully baked"]

For "SaaS app":
- P1 goal: "Set up development environment and hosting infrastructure"
- P1 why_it_matters: "Professional dev tools and deployment pipeline enable rapid iteration"
- P1 acceptance_criteria: ["Development environment configured", "Database and hosting set up", "Hello World app deployed"]

For "podcast":
- P1 goal: "Set up recording equipment and podcast hosting"
- P1 why_it_matters: "Professional audio quality and reliable hosting are essential for audience retention"
- P1 acceptance_criteria: ["Recording equipment tested", "Podcast hosting configured", "Test episode recorded and uploaded"]

BE SPECIFIC:
- Don't say "tools" - say what EXACT type of tools for this domain
- Don't be generic - reference the actual project type
- Make acceptance_criteria measurable and domain-specific
- Keep rollback_plan practical for this project type

PHASE: ${phase.phase_id} - ${phase.goal}
PROJECT VISION: ${goal}
PHASE PURPOSE: ${phase.why_it_matters}

üö® PHASE DISCIPLINE ENFORCEMENT:
You MUST respect the phase boundaries. Each phase has a specific purpose in the Zero-to-One journey:

${this.getPhaseConstraints(phase.phase_id)}

Your substeps MUST ONLY address activities within this phase's scope. Do NOT include:
- Activities from earlier phases (those are already complete)
- Activities from later phases (those are locked until this phase completes)
- Generic strategy work that belongs in a different phase

üìã MASTER PROMPT PRINCIPLES FOR THIS PHASE:
The expert master prompt for ${phase.phase_id} provides the strategic framework. Your substeps must align with these principles:

${masterPrompt}

Your substeps should break down these master prompt principles into concrete, executable tasks. Each substep must directly support one of the principles above.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
The "prompt_to_send" field is a SYSTEM-LEVEL instruction to an AI that will execute this substep. Write it as if you're instructing a senior expert to execute work on behalf of the user, then hand off deliverables for the user to review/modify.

‚ùå WRONG (first-person role-play):
"I'm a senior brand strategist. Let me build your brand identity..."

‚ùå WRONG (passive advice):
"Establish a clear brand identity. Use Canva to create a logo."

‚úÖ CORRECT (system-level expert instruction):
"You are a senior brand strategist with 20+ years of experience building iconic brands. We are in Phase P1: Build Environment ‚Äî Substep 2: Brand Identity Foundation for '${goal}'.

Execute this step now:
- Generate a complete brand identity system including color palette (3-4 colors with hex codes), typography recommendations, brand voice description, and mission statement
- Create a ready-to-use brand guide document the user can copy
- Return copy-paste-ready content with 2-3 sentences explaining why each choice supports the project vision

End by instructing the user to review the brand guide, make any modifications, and upload their finalized version. You will review and mark this substep complete."

MASTER PROMPT STRUCTURE:
1. Identity & Authority: "You are the [expert role] with 20+ years of experience..."
2. Context: "We are in Phase [P#]: [Phase Goal] ‚Äî Substep [#]: [Substep Label]"
3. Action to Execute: Clear commands of what to generate/build
4. Deliverable: Exact output format (code, document, template, etc.)
5. User Handoff: What user should do next and upload requirement

RULES:
1. Generate 3-5 substeps (15-30 min each)
2. Each prompt is written TO the AI, not AS the AI
3. Focus on generating copy-paste-ready deliverables
4. Always end with upload/review instruction
5. Keep substeps small enough to complete in one focused session

Your task is to generate a complete master prompt that will guide an AI expert through this phase.

THE MASTER PROMPT SHOULD:
1. Define the expert role (e.g., "senior DevOps engineer" for P1, "senior product designer" for P2, etc.) - MUST be hyper-specific to the project domain
2. Explain the phase purpose in context of THIS specific project (not generic advice)
3. Provide domain-specific principles and strategies
4. Include concrete examples relevant to this project type
5. Define what success looks like for THIS project in this phase

EXAMPLES OF GOOD MASTER PROMPTS:

For "cookie business" P1 (Build Environment):
"You are a senior food business operations manager with 20+ years launching commercial food products. Your task is to set up the complete infrastructure for a cookie business.

Essential Setup Strategy:
1. Commercial Kitchen: Identify whether home kitchen cottage laws apply or if commercial kitchen rental/licensing is needed. Research local health department requirements.
2. Equipment & Tools: Source professional baking equipment (commercial oven, mixers, cooling racks, storage containers). Don't start with industrial scale - begin with small batch equipment that can scale.
3. Business Licensing: Secure food handler certification, business license, and liability insurance. Many cookie businesses fail because they skip proper permitting.
4. Hello World Proof: Bake one test batch in your planned production space using the exact recipe and equipment you'll launch with. This validates your setup.

Success means: You can legally bake and sell cookies tomorrow if you had an order."

For "SaaS web app" P1 (Build Environment):
"You are a senior DevOps engineer with 20+ years setting up development environments for web applications. Your task is to build a professional development workflow for this SaaS project.

Essential Setup Strategy:
1. Development Stack: Set up Node.js + React + PostgreSQL + hosting (Vercel/Netlify/Railway). Choose based on the project's expected scale and your deployment needs.
2. Workspace Architecture: Initialize Git repo, configure ESLint/Prettier, set up package.json with all dependencies. Create clear folder structure (frontend/, backend/, shared/).
3. Cloud Accounts: Set up GitHub for version control, hosting platform account, database hosting (Supabase/Railway). Configure environment variables.
4. Hello World Proof: Deploy a simple "Hello World" full-stack app (API endpoint + frontend) to production URL. This validates your entire pipeline.

Success means: You can push code and see it live on the internet within minutes."
