CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:
The "prompt_to_send" field is a SYSTEM-LEVEL instruction to an AI that will execute this substep. Write it as if you're instructing a senior expert to execute work on behalf of the user, then hand off deliverables for the user to review/modify.

‚ùå WRONG (first-person role-play):
"I'm a senior brand strategist. Let me build your brand identity..."

‚ùå WRONG (passive advice):
"Establish a clear brand identity. Use Canva to create a logo."

‚úÖ CORRECT (system-level expert instruction):
"You are a senior brand strategist with 20+ years of experience building iconic brands. We are in Phase P1: Build Environment ‚Äî Substep 2: Brand Identity Foundation for '${goal}'.

Execute this step now:
- Generate a complete brand identity system including color palette (3-4 colors with hex codes), typography recommendations, brand voice description, and mission statement
- Create a ready-to-use brand guide document the user can copy
- Return copy-paste-ready content with 2-3 sentences explaining why each choice supports the project vision

End by instructing the user to review the brand guide, make any modifications, and upload their finalized version. You will review and mark this substep complete."

MASTER PROMPT STRUCTURE:
1. Identity & Authority: "You are the [expert role] with 20+ years of experience..."
2. Context: "We are in Phase [P#]: [Phase Goal] ‚Äî Substep [#]: [Substep Label]"
3. Action to Execute: Clear commands of what to generate/build
4. Deliverable: Exact output format (code, document, template, etc.)
5. User Handoff: What user should do next and upload requirement

RULES:
1. Generate 3-5 substeps (15-30 min each)
2. Each prompt is written TO the AI, not AS the AI
3. Focus on generating copy-paste-ready deliverables
4. Always end with upload/review instruction
5. Keep substeps small enough to complete in one focused session

      P1: `A professional environment is the foundation of success. Here's how to set up like a pro:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**Essential Setup Strategy:**

1. **Tools & Infrastructure**: Identify the core tools professionals in this domain use daily. Don't over-engineer - start with the 3-5 most critical ones.

2. **Workspace Architecture**: Design your space (physical or digital) for deep work. Remove distractions, organize resources within arm's reach, establish clear boundaries.

3. **Professional Credibility**: Secure any licenses, permits, accounts, or credentials needed to operate legitimately in this space.

4. **Proof-of-Concept Milestone**: Create the smallest possible demonstration that your setup works - a "hello world" moment that proves you're ready to build.

**Pro Tip**: The goal isn't perfection, it's professional capability. You should feel confident saying "I'm ready to start" after this phase.

**Domain-Specific Considerations**: Different project types need different setups. A tech project needs development environment, a business needs legal structure, a creative project needs production tools.`,

      P2: `Every successful project starts with the simplest version that proves the core concept. Here's the input‚Üíprocess‚Üíoutput framework:

**Project Vision:** ${userVision}

**Core Loop Essentials:**

1. **Define Your Input**: What's the simplest form of raw material your project consumes? (customer request, data, raw material, etc.)

2. **Design Your Process**: What's the ONE core transformation that creates value? Strip away everything else.

3. **Deliver Your Output**: What's the minimal viable result that proves your concept works?

**The 24-Hour Rule**: Your core loop must be completable in one focused work session. If it takes longer, it's not minimal enough.

**Real-World Examples:**
- App: Single button ‚Üí simple function ‚Üí visible result
- Business: One customer ‚Üí core service ‚Üí payment received
- Content: One piece ‚Üí distribution ‚Üí audience feedback

**Success Metric**: Someone else should be able to understand your project's value proposition within 30 seconds of seeing your core loop in action.`,

      P3: `Strategic expansion beats feature creep every time. Here's how to grow systematically:

**Current Foundation:** ${userVision}

**The Single-Addition Principle:**

1. **Assess What's Working**: Document exactly what your current version does well. Don't break what's already valuable.

2. **Identify the One Big Gap**: What's the single most obvious limitation preventing wider adoption or deeper value?

3. **Layer, Don't Replace**: Add new functionality as a layer on top of existing systems, not a replacement for them.

4. **Test Continuously**: Each addition should be validated independently before moving to the next layer.

**Expansion Priority Framework:**
- **Must-Have**: Solves a real user pain point
- **Should-Have**: Enhances existing value significantly
- **Could-Have**: Nice to have, but doesn't move the needle

**The Golden Rule**: If you can't explain why this specific addition matters in one sentence, it's not ready to build.

**Next Layer Planning**: Always end this phase with a clear sense of what layer 3 should tackle.`,

      P4: `Real user feedback is the only validation that matters. Here's how to gather it without wasting time:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The 3-5 Person Rule**: More feedback isn't better feedback. Find 3-5 people who represent your target audience and go deep.

**Testing Structure:**

1. **What to Show**: Present your actual working project, not a mockup. Let them interact with the real thing.

2. **Questions That Matter**:
   - "What problem does this solve for you?"
   - "What would make this significantly more valuable?"
   - "Would you actually use/buy/recommend this?"

3. **Metrics to Track**:
   - Time to understand the value proposition
   - Willingness to take next action (sign up, pay, refer)
   - Specific improvement suggestions

**The Pivot vs. Proceed Decision Matrix:**
- **Proceed**: Clear value understanding + positive engagement + actionable feedback
- **Pivot**: Confusion about purpose + low engagement + fundamental objections

**Pro Insight**: If users can't explain your project's value in their own words, you haven't built the right thing yet.`,

      P5: `Launch-ready means good enough to put your reputation behind. Here's the quality threshold:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The Essential Fixes Framework:**

1. **Critical Path Issues**: Anything that breaks the core user journey must be fixed. No exceptions.

2. **Professional Polish**: Your project should feel intentional, not amateur. Focus on the details users actually notice.

3. **Scope Lock**: No new features. This phase is about fixing, not building.

**Priority Order:**
- **P0**: Core functionality broken or unreliable
- **P1**: User experience feels unprofessional or confusing
- **P2**: Edge cases that affect real usage
- **P3**: Nice-to-haves that don't impact launch success

**Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Core user journey works 100% of the time
- [ ] Error states are handled gracefully
- [ ] User interface feels intentional and clean
- [ ] Performance is acceptable for intended use
- [ ] Content is proofread and accurate

**The Launch Litmus Test**: Would you confidently demo this to someone whose opinion you respect?`,

      P6: `A focused launch beats a scattered announcement every time. Here's the proven formula:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The Single CTA Strategy:**

1. **One Clear Action**: What's the ONE thing you want people to do? Sign up, buy, download, follow? Pick one.

2. **Launch Platform Selection**: Where does your audience actually spend time? Start there, expand later.

3. **Message Clarity**: Your launch message should answer "What is this?" and "Why should I care?" in under 10 seconds.

**Launch Sequence:**
- **Pre-Launch**: Build anticipation with 2-3 people who care about your success
- **Launch Day**: Share in 2-3 places maximum, with consistent messaging
- **Post-Launch**: Follow up with initial users for testimonials and improvements

**Critical Metrics (First 72 Hours):**
1. **Awareness**: How many people saw your launch?
2. **Engagement**: How many took your desired action?
3. **Quality**: How positive was the initial feedback?

**Launch Success Formula**: Consistent message + Right audience + Clear next step = Sustainable momentum

**Pro Tip**: A small launch that gets real users beats a big launch that gets only views.`,

      P7: `The best builders learn systematically from every project. Here's how to capture what matters:

**Project Context:** ${userVision}

**The Three-Lens Analysis:**

1. **What Worked**: Document the decisions, processes, and strategies that delivered results. These become your repeatable playbook.

2. **What Didn't**: Identify the bottlenecks, mistakes, and dead ends. Understanding failure prevents repetition.

3. **What You'd Do Differently**: With perfect hindsight, what would you change about your approach?

**Personal Toolkit Development:**
- **Process Wins**: Which workflows made you most productive?
- **Tool Discoveries**: What software, resources, or methods proved invaluable?
- **Mental Models**: What frameworks helped you make better decisions?

**Next Project Planning:**
- **Skill Gaps**: What abilities would make your next project easier?
- **Resource Needs**: What tools or knowledge should you acquire first?
- **Project Selection**: Based on this experience, what type of project should you tackle next?

**Documentation Format**: Keep it simple - bullet points, not essays. Focus on actionable insights you'll actually reference later.

**The Growth Mindset**: Every project is training for the next one. The goal isn't perfection, it's systematic improvement.`,
