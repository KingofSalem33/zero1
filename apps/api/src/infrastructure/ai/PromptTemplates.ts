EXAMPLES:

For "cookie business":

- P1 why_it_matters: "Commercial kitchen permits, equipment, and food safety certifications are legally required before selling"
- P1 acceptance_criteria: ["Commercial kitchen licensed or home kitchen permitted", "Equipment installed and tested", "First test batch successfully baked"]

For "SaaS app":
- P1 goal: "Set up development environment and hosting infrastructure"
- P1 why_it_matters: "Professional dev tools and deployment pipeline enable rapid iteration"
- P1 acceptance_criteria: ["Development environment configured", "Database and hosting set up", "Hello World app deployed"]

For "podcast":
- P1 goal: "Set up recording equipment and podcast hosting"
- P1 why_it_matters: "Professional audio quality and reliable hosting are essential for audience retention"
- P1 acceptance_criteria: ["Recording equipment tested", "Podcast hosting configured", "Test episode recorded and uploaded"]

BE SPECIFIC:
- Don't say "tools" - say what EXACT type of tools for this domain
- Don't be generic - reference the actual project type
- Make acceptance_criteria measurable and domain-specific
- Keep rollback_plan practical for this project type

Generate 3-5 substeps that:
1. Are concrete, actionable tasks
2. Build sequentially (each substep enables the next)
3. Have clear completion criteria
4. Are appropriately scoped for a beginner
5. Include specific technical guidance

Each substep should have:

- prompt_to_send: Detailed instructions (2-3 paragraphs) that:
  * Explain WHY this step matters
  * Provide step-by-step guidance
  * Include specific examples for THIS project type
  * Reference previous substeps when relevant
  * End with concrete completion criteria

Make the substeps HYPER-SPECIFIC to "${projectGoal}" - not generic.

- Substep 1: "Set up Git repository and version control"
- Substep 2: "Configure Node.js development environment"

Tool usage rules (strict):
- When calling web_search, you MUST include a complete 'q' string with jurisdiction + topic + 'site:.gov' (e.g., 'Minnesota cottage food law site:mn.gov'). Never call web_search without 'q'.
- When calling http_fetch, you MUST include a full 'url' starting with http(s). Never call http_fetch without 'url'.

When using web_search or http_fetch tools:
1. Synthesize information from multiple sources into a comprehensive answer
2. Provide specific details, examples, and actionable insights
3. Present information naturally in paragraph form, not as a list of links
4. The system will automatically display citations at the end - don't mention URLs in your response

Provide comprehensive, helpful responses using the tools when appropriate. Be conversational and thorough like ChatGPT.

After providing your response, ask the immediate next logical question to aid the user in completing the task. Be direct and specific - focus on the exact next action needed.

- Feature-focused ("app with notifications")
- Multiple audiences in one sentence

You're setting up the foundation for your project. Think of this like a chef preparing their mise en place before cooking.

**Strategic Context:**
Without a proper environment, you'll waste time fighting tools instead of building. This phase ensures you can iterate quickly and deploy confidently.

**Step-by-Step Guidance:**
1. Set up version control (Git) - your safety net for experiments
2. Configure your development environment - the tools you'll use daily
3. Set up hosting/deployment - proof that your work reaches real users
4. Create a "Hello World" - verify everything works end-to-end

**Common Mistakes:**
- Over-engineering the setup (keep it simple!)
- Skipping deployment until "later" (deploy early, deploy often)
- Not testing the full pipeline (dev â†’ production)

**Success Criteria:**
You can make a small change, commit it, and see it live in production within 5 minutes.

**Next Preview:**
Once your environment is ready, we'll build your first working feature - where your idea starts to take real shape.`,

      P2: `Master Prompt: Core Loop for "${userVision}"

You're building the smallest version that proves your idea works. This is your MVP's MVP.

**Strategic Context:**
The core loop is the heart of your project - the fundamental value you provide. Get this right, and everything else becomes easier.

**Step-by-Step Guidance:**
1. Define the simplest input â†’ process â†’ output flow
2. Build it without polish (rough is fine)
3. Test with real data (not hypothetical)
4. Verify the output delivers value

**Common Mistakes:**
- Building features before the core works
- Making it pretty before it works
- Testing with fake data

**Success Criteria:**
Someone can give you real input and get real, valuable output within 30 seconds.

**Next Preview:**
With a working core, we'll layer on your first enhancement - making it better, not just bigger.`,
