State: ${completedAnalysis.implementation_state}
Tech Stack: ${completedAnalysis.tech_stack.join(", ") || "N/A"}

**NEXT SUBSTEP:**
Label: ${nextSubstep.label}
Requirements: ${nextSubstep.prompt_to_send?.substring(0, 300)}...

**YOUR TASK:**
Generate a message that:
1. **Celebrates** their achievement (1-2 sentences, specific to what they built)
2. **Transitions smoothly** to the next substep (no gap, no asking permission)
3. **Briefs them** on what's next (why it matters, what they'll build)
4. **Starts the work** with a concrete first action

**FORMAT:**
âœ… [Specific celebration about what they achieved]

ðŸŽ¯ Next: [Next substep title]
[1-2 sentences: why this substep matters]

[Concrete first action or guidance to start the work]

**TONE:**
- Encouraging but not patronizing
- Specific to their project (use their vision/tech)
- Action-oriented (momentum, not explanation)
- Natural conversational flow

**EXAMPLE (for a teacher app):**
âœ… Excellent work! Your environment is fully configured with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. You ran the Hello World successfullyâ€”everything is working.

ðŸŽ¯ Next: Build the Core Loop
Now we're creating the heart of your lesson-sharing platform: the ability for teachers to upload a lesson and see it displayed in a feed. This proves the concept works before we add complexity.

I'm going to help you build:
- Database schema for lessons (title, content, author)
- Upload form component
- Feed display component

Let's start with the database. Here's the schema we need...
